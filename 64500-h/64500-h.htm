3</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> myths of
paganism,&rdquo; says Professor Huxley, <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> &ldquo;are as dead as Osiris or Zeus,
and the man who should revive them, in opposition to the
knowledge of our time, would be justly laughed to scorn; but the
coeval imaginations current among the rude inhabitants of
Palestine, recorded by writers whose very name and age are
admitted by every scholar to be unknown, have unfortunately not
yet shared their fate; but even at this day are regarded by
nine-tenths of the civilised world as the authoritative standard
of fact, and the criterion of the justice of scientific
conclusions in all that relates to the origin of things, and
among them of species.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this 19th century, as at the dawn of modern physical
science, the cosmogony of the semi-barbarous Hebrew is the
incubus of the philosopher and the opprobrium of the
orthodox.&nbsp; Who shall number the patient and earnest seekers
after truth . . . whose lives have been embittered and good name
blasted by the mistaken zeal of bibliolaters?&nbsp; Who shall
count the host of weaker men whose sense of truth has been
destroyed in the effort to harmonise impossibilities,&mdash;whose
life has been wasted in the attempt to force the generous new
wine of science into the old bottle of Judaism?&nbsp; It is true
that if philosophers have suffered, their cause has been amply
avenged.&nbsp; Extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of
every science, as the strangled snakes beside that of Hercules;
and history records that whenever science and <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>orthodoxy have
been fairly opposed, the latter has been forced to retire from
the lists, bleeding and crushed, if not annihilated; scotched, if
not slain.&nbsp; But orthodoxy is the Bourbon of the world of
thought: it learns not, neither can it forget; and though at
present bewildered and afraid to move, it is as willing as ever
to insist that the first chapter of Genesis contains the
beginning and the end of sound science, and to visit with such
petty thunderbolts as its half-paralysed hands can hurl those who
refuse to degrade Nature to the level of primitive
Judaism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We purpose, in this pamphlet, with all possible brevity, to
show that Scripture is irreconcilable with science, experience,
and even with its own statements.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span><span
class="smcap">Part</span> I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SCRIPTURE IRRECONCILABLE WITH
SCIENCE.</span></h2>
<h3>(1.)&nbsp; <i>The Mosaic Cosmogony</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not our intention to go with
any minuteness into the thrice-told tale of the antagonism
between the Mosaic cosmogony and the revelations of
geology.&nbsp; That only five days intervened between the
creation of heaven and that of man is contradicted by every
stratum of the earth.</p>
<p>We readily admit that the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; is used in
Scripture in a very vague sense, and that even the limiting
phrase &ldquo;evening and morning&rdquo; by no means
circumscribes the interval to twenty-four hours.&nbsp; As the sun
did not even exist till the fourth of these days, the three
preceding ones could not possibly have been divided by its
setting and rising.</p>
<p>In like manner it may be admitted that Daniel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;vision of the evening and morning&rdquo; (viii., 26)
covers a period of 2,300 days, and his &ldquo;seventy
weeks&rdquo; (ix., 24) may be 490 years, that is seventy weeks of
years; but all this gives very little relief to the real
difficulties.&nbsp; It is not true that there ever was a period
like that called by Moses &ldquo;the third day;&rdquo; a period
when the earth was drained, the sea gathered into its bed, the
rivers and lakes confined to their proper boundaries, grass
growing on the mountains, trees in the forests, fruits in the
vineyards, and all the vegetable kingdom complete; yet no fish in
the waters, no creeping thing on the earth, no bird in the
air.&nbsp; Even in the Cambrian period may be traced the
rudiments of animal life; and in the Silurian, long before any
trace of land plants can be detected, certain molluscs were so
abundant that the period of this formation has been distinctly
called &ldquo;The age of brachiopods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to the Silurian or mollusc period comes the Devonian or
&ldquo;age of fishes,&rdquo; when the seas literally swarmed with
inhabitants, and it is not till we arrive at the coal formation
that we come to the &ldquo;vegetable age.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what
were these vegetables? principally ferns and mosses, a rank
production, which can in no wise answer to the description:
&ldquo;The earth brought forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and
the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind . . . and the
evening and the morning were the third day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But of this enough.&nbsp; Come we to the physical features of
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the heavens
and the earth according to the writers of the Old and New
Testaments.</p>
<p>The earth is represented by these writers as immovable in the
centre of the universe, and the heavenly bodies are described as
revolving round it.&nbsp; The clouds (<i>rakia</i>) are supposed
to be a solid body sustaining an ocean of water similar to the
seas: &ldquo;God said, let there be a firmament (<i>rakia</i>) in
the midst of [or between] the waters, and let it divide the
waters [of the sea] from the waters [of the clouds], and it was
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; This solid firmament, or roof of the earth, is
said to have windows or casements in it, which are opened to let
the rain fall through.</p>
<p>The New Testament makes no advance upon these primitive
notions.&nbsp; We are told (Matt, iv., 8) that the devil on one
occasion took Jesus to a high mountain, and showed him thence
&ldquo;all the kingdoms of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course the
writer supposed the world to be a flat surface, the whole of
which could be seen from one spot, if of sufficient
elevation.&nbsp; In like manner the solidity of the clouds is
taken for granted, for thrones are set upon them, and Christ, it
is said, will show himself hereafter &ldquo;sitting on the
clouds,&rdquo; attended with his court of angels.</p>
<p>We grant that many expressions of daily use will not bear a
close analysis.&nbsp; Thus we talk of being &ldquo;charmed&rdquo;
and &ldquo;enchanted&rdquo; without the remotest idea of
incantation; and when we say &ldquo;the sun rises and sets&rdquo;
we ignore the active character of these phrases.&nbsp; These, and
hundreds of other words, have acquired a conventional meaning:
thus charmed means &ldquo;greatly delighted,&rdquo; and the
phrases &ldquo;rising in the east&rdquo; and &ldquo;setting in
the west,&rdquo; applied to the sun, mean simply that it shows
itself at daybreak in the east, and as the day closes disappears
in the west.</p>
<p>This conventional use of words is a very different matter to
the endorsing of vulgar errors.&nbsp; To say that the sun rises
and sets can mislead no one.&nbsp; It teaches nothing beyond an
optical fact, and can in no wise justify such teaching as this:
The earth is a vast plane, buoyed up on a bed of water; and under
this water is the region of hell, where Satan rules supreme over
the fallen angels.&nbsp; The clouds are a solid roof sustaining
an aerial ocean, the fountain of our rain; and above this is the
region of heaven, where God rules as an earthly potentate, and
where are mansions, streets, rivers, and trees, after the fashion
of this earth.</p>
<p>It is said again, if Moses had written like a modern
geologist, <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>no one would have understood him.&nbsp; Apply this to
Newton, or any early teacher of a new science.&nbsp; What would
be said of Newton, if he had taught the myths of Scandinavian
mythology under a similar plea?&nbsp; If his discoveries of light
and gravitation were not new, they were no discoveries at all;
but if they were new they were unknown.&nbsp; It is the part of a
teacher to teach, to correct errors, and not to perpetuate them;
to tell what is not known, and not confirm the folly of ignorance
and superstition.</p>
<p>Once more.&nbsp; It is said that the object of the Bible is to
teach religion and not science.&nbsp; Granted.&nbsp; And the
object of an astronomer is to teach astronomy, of a geologist to
teach geology.&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Is the astronomer and
geologist free to revel in all sorts of errors provided they do
not affect his special science?&nbsp; No one would advance such a
plea except for a sinister purpose.&nbsp; But admitting it for
the sake of argument, what is gained by the admission?&nbsp; The
express object of the first chapter of Genesis is to teach
science.&nbsp; It professes to tell us how the world was made;
and all its teaching is wrong.&nbsp; The object of Genesis vii.
and viii. is to teach history.&nbsp; It professes to tell us how
the world was destroyed by a flood; and the teaching is all
wrong.&nbsp; The object of Genesis xi. is to teach
ethnology.&nbsp; It professes to tell us how men became dispersed
over the earth, and how it is that different nations speak
different tongues; and the teaching is all wrong.&nbsp; It is no
justification to plead that Moses was not skilled in geology,
history, and ethnology.&nbsp; If he knew nothing about these
matters, why did he profess to teach them, and why give it out
that what he taught was told him by God?&nbsp; If God is the God
of truth he can no more teach false science than false morals; it
is equally untruthful to falsify a scientific or historical fact,
as to falsify a moral precept or church doctrine.</p>
<p>It is said that the writers of Scripture were inspired by
divine wisdom to write nothing but truth.&nbsp; Now either the
world was made in six days or it was not; either the flood
covered the whole world or it did not; either the sun stood still
at the bidding of Joshua or it did not; either Balaam&rsquo;s ass
spoke Hebrew and the serpent in the garden spoke the language of
Adam, or they did not.&nbsp; If these things are not positive
facts they are fictions, and could only deceive as they still
do.&nbsp; It is inconceivable that Professor Airy or Huxley,
knowing certain facts, should write a book and wholly ignore that
knowledge.&nbsp; It would be puerile in the extreme if they were
to plead in excuse for such folly that they were writing <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>on another
subject.&nbsp; The true question is this: were they knowingly
stating fiction and falsehoods as veritable facts?&nbsp; If they
knew that man was not made of dust, nor woman of a rib taken out
of Adam while he was asleep; if they knew that the world was not
made in six days, but affirmed that it was; if they knew that the
serpent was not doomed to crawl on the ground and eat dust
because the devil chose to assume its shape, but said that it
did, then are they altogether to blame, and it is a matter wholly
indifferent whether they were writing science or theology.&nbsp;
So with the &ldquo;inspired penmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; They profess to
write truth, to write facts, and if the words they utter are not
truths, and the events they record are not facts, it is quite
beside the question whether they pertain to the immediate object
of their books or not.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is said that science at present is unsettled, and
therefore it is too early to pronounce upon the scientific
teaching of the Bible.&nbsp; No doubt there are questions in
science still <i>in nubibus</i>, and others <i>sub judice</i>,
but what of that?&nbsp; Because a science is still not fully
developed, is it worth nothing? has it no voice, no
authority?&nbsp; It is still doubtful whether some of the
nebul&aelig; are unfinished stars, or stars so thickly clustered
together that at this distance they look like a
&ldquo;cloud.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because this question is not fully
determined, must we ignore the fact that the earth is a globe;
that the planets roll round the sun; that the clouds are due to
evaporation, and rain to a change of temperature?&nbsp; The Bible
says the earth is a plane, and the clouds a solid flooring; that
the sun, moon, and stars are set in the atmosphere between the
upper and lower waters.&nbsp; We are told to suspend judgment on
these points, because there are problems of astronomy and geology
yet unsolved.&nbsp; This indeed is clinging to a hopeless hope;
it is the obstinacy of a Gambetta, who finding no help in man,
dreamt in his enthusiasm that the stars in their courses would
fight for France against the Prussians.</p>
<p>To return to the Mosaic notion of creation.&nbsp; The writer
tells us that man was made in the image of God&mdash;a male and a
female.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness.&nbsp; So God created man in his own image; in the image
of God created he him; male and female created he
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; This seems to imply an Isis as well as an
Osiris, a female as well as a male deity, and no doubt Moses, who
derived his inspiration from the Egyptian priests, believed this
sexual divinity.&nbsp; But what is meant by &ldquo;the image and
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>likeness of
God?&rdquo;&nbsp; We are told over and over again that God has no
image, no bodily form, and we are forbidden to make any likeness
of any creature and look on it as a likeness of God.&nbsp;
Theologians tell us the likeness referred to is righteousness and
true holiness.&nbsp; But why say &ldquo;the image and
likeness?&rdquo; <i>image</i> seems to point to bodily
form.&nbsp; Besides, Adam was not like God in holiness and true
righteousness, for he hearkened to temptation, and if he was
&ldquo;like God,&rdquo; it implies that Satan might delude even
God, and that God might by possibility fall like Adam.</p>
<p>Having made man, the writer says: &ldquo;God ended his
work&rdquo; (Gen. ii., 2).&nbsp; He made man and ceased the work
of creation.&nbsp; Strange, that the writer should say this, and
yet in the very same chapter contradict the statement, by the
&ldquo;new creation&rdquo; of a woman!&nbsp; The dogma, however,
that the creative work of God was sealed up, never to be
re-opened when man was made, is in direct antagonism to the whole
reading of the rocks.&nbsp; Geology shows us worlds of extinct
vegetables and animals, the types of which, in one geological
period differed entirely from those which existed at a succeeding
one, and every anterior period had a flora and a fauna wholly
unlike any of those with which we are familiar.&nbsp; There are
hosts of creations at every era, and there has never been a
period from the mystical &ldquo;Beginning,&rdquo; when the
creative force has ceased from its operations.&nbsp; At one
period we see nothing superior to shell-fish and sea-worms, and
for a time the work of creation seems ended; but another set of
rocks unfold themselves, and show us myriads of molluscs,
especially of the arm-footed kind, trilobites and graptolites,
stone-lilies and corals.&nbsp; Again a change comes over created
things: mountains are upheaved, but no grass grows upon their
sides, the ocean bed is contracted, and the waters are tenanted
by innumerable swarms of fishes, for the most part unlike any
which now exist.&nbsp; This dynasty of the fishy tribe gives
place in time to the &ldquo;age of ferns and mosses,&rdquo; and
the lizard race makes its appearance; but it is not till we come
to the &ldquo;secondary group of rocks&rdquo; that we meet with
the fish-lizards and the predacious plesiosaur, the bird-beaked
saurian, and the labyrinthodon.&nbsp; Ages roll on, ages past all
calculation, and new families of molluscs, fishes, and reptiles
put in their appearance for the first time: ammonites and
belemnites among the molluscs; eryons and horse-shoes among
crustaceans; pterodactyls, teliosaurs, steneosaurs, and
megalosaurs among reptiles, with here and there a sort of
opossum, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>the first type of the mammal family.&nbsp; In the air
flew the giant pterodactyl; on the dry land stalked the ponderous
megalosaurus; in the sea whole hosts of marine lizards pursued
their carnivorous instincts.&nbsp; Huge turtles crept along the
muddy coasts, and strange fishes swam in the deep ocean; but no
man existed; no flocks fed upon the mountains; no birds carrolled
in the groves.&nbsp; The lordly lion commanded not in the forest;
the majestic eagle was not the king of birds.&nbsp; The master
spirits were saurians, whose sway was universal; and this brings
us to the third great era, that of the tertiary rocks.&nbsp; This
third series of rocks contain fossils more and more nearly allied
to existing plants and animals; we meet with mammals in
considerable numbers, but by far the largest number of them are
thick-skinned, and, as a rule, they were both more bulky and
longer in the legs than those which now exist.</p>
<p>Coming at last to the age of man and existing species, we
still find the work of creation has not ceased.&nbsp; Every new
manufacture brings forth some new form of plant or animal, so
that creative force can no more cease from operation than any
other form of force.&nbsp; If God is the Creator he must create;
there can be no <i>was</i> or <i>has been</i> with deity; deity
must of necessity be always the universal <i>Now</i>, the great
<i>I am</i>.&nbsp; Infinite love must always be loving, for love
without loving is no longer love.&nbsp; Infinite power must
always be potential, for to remit the potentiality of power is to
lose the power.&nbsp; Power and force are not latent faculties,
but active only.&nbsp; In man it is otherwise, because man, as
man, has a beginning and therefore an end, and the works of such
a creature must have the same limits; but power, as power, cannot
possibly begin and end; if it has a beginning that beginning must
be the result of <i>previous</i> power, which is absurd; and if
it has an end it is no longer power, which is a
contradiction.</p>
<p>Man is the creature of a day, and when the day is over it can
be said of man he <i>was</i>, and of the works of man they
<i>once were</i>.&nbsp; As with man there is a past, so must
there be a future.&nbsp; To every <i>was</i> there must belong a
<i>shall be</i>.&nbsp; Man, therefore, can be an inventor, a
doer, a maker, and cease inventing, doing, making, as he can
cease living, or exhaust the limit of his faculties; but God
cannot be a creator one day and not another, a doer yesterday and
not to-morrow, an agent at one time and not another, or his works
would have a past, and if a past a future also; and whatever has
a past and future must belong to time; nay more, whatever has a
past and <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>future must of necessity be finite, limited, and
imperfect.&nbsp; If God is infinite, the great &ldquo;I
Am,&rdquo; the &ldquo;same yesterday, today, and for ever,&rdquo;
it can never be said of His operations they once were, but are
now ended; He was once a Creator, but is so no longer; His power
to create was once active in its potentiality, but has ever since
been in abeyance.&nbsp; Every faculty of the infinite, every act
and attribute must itself be infinite, with no remission, and no
shadow of turning.&nbsp; To say that God ended His work of
creation on the sixth day and ceased from His labour, is to
predicate change in the unchangeable, limitation in the infinite,
rest in activity, repose in motion.&nbsp; It is to humanise
deity, mortalise immortality, temporise eternity, limit infinity,
and make a past to the everlasting &ldquo;Now.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
to make God a man, differing only in degree; eternity time,
differing only in extension; the ever present a mere <i>now</i>
between a &ldquo;was&rdquo; and a &ldquo;will be.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Facts, therefore, as well as reflection must show the untruth of
the dogma that for six days God was a creator, and then ended His
work, and ceased from His labour.</p>
<h3>(2.)&nbsp; <i>The Fall</i>.</h3>
<p>As a supplement to the cosmogony, comes the legend of the
Fall.&nbsp; Of course, the object of this tale is to account for
the fancied imperfection of the works of God.&nbsp; The gist of
the matter is this: Adam and Eve were commanded to abstain from a
certain tree growing in Eden.&nbsp; This abstinence was to be the
test of their obedience.&nbsp; The devil tempted Eve to eat of
the forbidden fruit, and Eve induced Adam to do the same.&nbsp;
In consequence of this disobedience, God cursed the serpent whose
form Satan had assumed;&mdash;he cursed the ground, causing it to
bring forth thorns and thistles; cursed Eve in her instincts of
love and maternal functions, and Adam in assigning him the toil
of working for his daily bread.&nbsp; Over all came the sentence
of death: &ldquo;By one man sin entered into the world, and death
by sin&rdquo; (Rom. v., 12).</p>
<p>According to this legend, &ldquo;death is the wages of
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Adam&rsquo;s apostacy that brought both
sin and death into the world, but neither sin nor death can
possibly be due to such a cause.&nbsp; Adam&rsquo;s apostacy
could not bring &ldquo;sin&rdquo; into the world.&nbsp; <i>The
very act of disobedience is a proof that</i>
&ldquo;<i>sin</i>&rdquo; <i>already existed</i>.&nbsp; The sin
preceded the overt act, was the cause of it, and the cause must
inevitably exist before its effect.&nbsp; It was sin that
produced apostacy, and not apostacy <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>which produced sin.&nbsp; Take the
case of Cain: It is said that Cain slew his brother Abel.&nbsp;
What would be thought of the logician who should affirm that
because Cain slew Abel, hatred was introduced into the heart of
man, and that death should follow as a perpetual
punishment?&nbsp; Should we not reply, it was because Cain hated
Abel that he rose up and slew him?&nbsp; The passion of hatred
preceded the act of murder.&nbsp; It was malice aforethought, and
if anything resulted from the misdeed, it was not hatred but
contrition, not thoughts of evil but thoughts of bitter
grief.&nbsp; Hatred was the cause of murder, and murder the
parent of sorrow.&nbsp; So with Adam and Eve.&nbsp; If there had
not been already &ldquo;an evil heart of unbelief,&rdquo; there
never would have been an act of disobedience.&nbsp; Eve sinned,
not because she was innocent, but because she was sinful.&nbsp;
She disobeyed, not because she was obedient, but because her
heart &ldquo;was not right with God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bare act
was nothing, the sin was there already, and if she had never
eaten of the tree, the thought of her heart would have been
sin.&nbsp; It is not true, therefore, that sin is the consequence
of Adam&rsquo;s apostacy, inasmuch as it produced the apostacy
itself.&nbsp; By one man&rsquo;s disobedience sin did <i>not</i>
enter into the world, neither is it true that death is &ldquo;the
wages of sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below the surface of the earth for the depth of some six or
eight miles, thousands and millions of once living creatures lie
buried in the rocks; creatures which lived and died before man
had any being.&nbsp; Of these creatures, myriads were
carnivorous; and one specimen, at least, has been disinterred of
a fossil animal inclosed in the body of another, by whom it had
been devoured for food.</p>
<p>Hence, death existed long, long before the very creation of
man; millions upon millions of animals were buried in the rocks
before Eve was made of the sleeper&rsquo;s rib.&nbsp; So says
geology, and what is the testimony of physiology?</p>
<p>Every leaf and blade of grass, every drop of water, and even
the invisible air, are crowded with insects and animalcules;
insomuch that not a leaf can be eaten, not a drop of water can be
drank, not a gasp of air can be inhaled, without destroying the
life of some insect creatures.&nbsp; If, however, only one insect
or animalcule died before the Fall; if by the effect of
earthquake or volcano, the force of tempest, the rending of
rocks, the slip of an avalanche, the fall of a tree, or even by
accident, one animal lost its life, the point is proved; for that
one animal at least died, and therefore death was not the
consequence of a disobedience not yet incurred.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Again,
it is well known that carnivorous beasts and birds of prey have
an anatomy adapted to their predacious habits.&nbsp; Their teeth
or beak, their paws or talons, their whole structure and
digestive organs, prove that they live on carrion, and a lion
could no more eat straw like an ox, than an ox could eat carrion
like a lion.&nbsp; If, therefore, there was no death before the
Fall, we are reduced to one or other of these dilemmas: Either
there were no animals that lived on prey, or else at the Fall all
predacious animals were wholly recreated, their teeth and jaws
were re-constructed, their beaks and talons, their organs of
deglutition and digestion; in short, their entire anatomical
structure.&nbsp; A gratuitous assertion wholly incapable of
proof, and contradicted by every animal fossil in the pre-Adamite
world.</p>
<h3>(3.)&nbsp; <i>The Noachian Flood</i>.</h3>
<p>What we said of the cosmogony we repeat under this head also:
it is not our intention to enter upon this subject at any
length.&nbsp; It has been proved to demonstration that no single
trace of such a cataclysm can be detected in the rocks or
features of the earth; but all these rocks and all these features
bear their testimony against such an event.</p>
<p>No doubt the stratified rocks speak of the agency of water,
but that agency was not the deluge.&nbsp; No doubt the gravel and
the boulders found so extensively accumulated over the northern
hemisphere were carried from their native places by the force of
water; but that water was not the flood.&nbsp; No doubt traces of
marine animals may be discovered on every high mountain, no
matter how far that mountain may be distant from the main ocean;
but these fossils were not deposited there by the breaking up of
the great deep and the 40 days of incessant rain which fell upon
the ark.&nbsp; These fossils extend downwards for some six or
eight miles in depth, and how could a flood of some few months in
duration make such a deposit?&nbsp; The fossils of the rocks are
all deposited in the nicest order; those of one period are never
mixed with the fossils of another.&nbsp; No antiquarian could
sort his specimens with more order.&nbsp; No museum could observe
more method in its arrangements.&nbsp; A deluge would sweep down
everything in confusion and bury plants, animals, and minerals in
one common ruin; such is not the character of the
rocks&mdash;every fossil reveals the rocks from which it was dug,
and every rock will tell the searcher what fossils he may expect
to find there.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>We are
told that the animals taken into the ark were the same as those
which existed on the earth when the flood came, and that the
animals preserved by Noah were the parents of existing species;
but the fossils of the rocks are wholly different to any existing
specimens of plant or animal.&nbsp; Shell fish are found upon
inland mountains, but not the shell fish of our present
system.&nbsp; Bones of animals are found far from the native
haunts of the living creatures, but they are altogether strange
bones, and never belonged to the animals of the ark.&nbsp; They
are all relics of extinct species, and amongst all the fossils no
trace of man can be detected.&nbsp; No trace of the houses built
by Cain and his offspring.&nbsp; No trace of the iron and brass
instruments forged by Tubal-Cain and his descendants.&nbsp; We
find traces of the most delicate leaves of plants, traces of
birds, and beasts, and creeping things; but none of man, or of
the works of man.&nbsp; If the same flood swept away both man and
beast, bird and fish, reptile and insect, tree and boulder, how
is it we never find them buried in the same bed&mdash;overwhelmed
in the same grave?&nbsp; Demonstration could not go
further.&nbsp; The whole earth from its lowest depth to its
surface denies the universality of the flood, and not one
particle of proof can be pointed out in confirmation of the
legend.</p>
<p>Moses says that the fountains of the great deep were broken up
(Gen. vii., 11).&nbsp; He believed that there was a subterranean
abyss of water under the earth, <a name="citation14a"></a><a
href="#footnote14a" class="citation">[14a]</a> and the Rev.
William Kirby, in one of the &ldquo;Bridgewater Treatises,&rdquo;
<a name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a> actually attempts to justify this
notion.&nbsp; It would be an insult to the understanding of our
reader to waste arguments on such a hypothesis.&nbsp; It is
enough to state it, and it must fall with the weight of its own
worthlessness.</p>
<p>Again.&nbsp; Moses says, &ldquo;And the waters prevailed
exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high hills that were
under the whole heaven were covered.&nbsp; Fifteen cubits upwards
did the waters prevail, and the mountains were covered&rdquo;
(Gen. vii., 19, 20).&nbsp; Moses says the depth of the water was
15 cubits, and that all the high hills that were under the whole
heaven were covered.&nbsp; Of course the writer was ignorant of
that simple principle, known now to every schoolboy, that water
finds its level.&nbsp; He supposed that it would follow the
irregularities of the earth&rsquo;s surface, here investing a
mountain <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>and there dipping into the valleys, so that a uniform
depth was preserved throughout, the highest hills being covered
with a depth of 15 cubits like the valleys.&nbsp; We must, per
force, believe this, or we are driven to the more unlikely
hypothesis, that Moses supposed a level of some 30 feet deep of
water would suffice to cover the loftiest mountains. <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; Whichever solution is taken, the
inference is the same&mdash;that the statement is wholly
irreconcilable with science.</p>
<p>Once more.&nbsp; After the waters had prevailed for about a
year, Noah sent forth a dove, and the dove came back to the ark
with an &ldquo;olive leaf plucked off&rdquo; (Gen. viii.,
11).&nbsp; This olive tree withstood the pelting rain, withstood
the rush of the subsiding water, withstood the wind that drove
the waters back to their abyss; but what is stranger still, it
blossomed under water, and when its head was left towering above
the flood which enveloped its trunk, its branches had put forth
leaves.&nbsp; Probably the grass was not injured by the flood, as
the beasts were dismissed from the ark to find their own
food.&nbsp; Strange that trees and herbs, covered with a depth of
30 feet of water, should grow just as well as in the sunshine;
but small inconsistencies of this sort are as nothing to the
glaring impossibility of the whole legend.</p>
<p>Many other examples of a similar contrariety might be added,
but the mere multiplication of evidence can serve no useful
purpose when enough has been brought forth to establish the point
in question.&nbsp; We might refer to the miracle of Joshua (x.,
12.) in proof of the vulgar notion that it is the sun which moves
over the earth, not the earth round the sun; we might direct
attention to Gen. ix., 13, in proof that Moses supposed the
rainbow to be a miraculous exhibition of God&rsquo;s power in
confirmation of his covenant with Noah; or we might dwell on the
2nd Epistle of Peter (iii., 10&ndash;12) to show that the prince
of the Apostles believed that the heavens could be burnt with
fire, like the roof of a house, and the elements be melted by
fervent heat.&nbsp; We might cite a whole host of verses to prove
that the Scripture writers believed the earth to be a vast plane
with an abyss, and the whole rigidly fixed on a solid foundation
wholly immovable.</p>
<p>Or we might turn to the physiological notions of the Bible
writers to show that they were no more in advance of the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>period than
their notions of astronomy, geology, and general history.&nbsp;
They referred intellectual operations to the kidneys or
reins:&mdash;&ldquo;My reins instruct me in the night
season&rdquo; (Ps. xvi., 7).&nbsp; The affections they ascribe to
the heart, and bodily pain to the bones.&nbsp; They believed
epilepsy to result from demoniacal possession; that mandrakes
provoked fecundity in women (Gen. xxx., 14&ndash;16; Cant. vii.,
13.); that peeled withes, placed before pregnant ewes, would
affect the colour of their lambs (Gen. xxx., 37.); that ants eat
corn and lay up for themselves a store for winter (Prov. v., 6.);
that bees can be generated from a dead carcase (Judges xiv., 8.);
that falling meteors or stars prognosticate evil (Ezek. xxxii.,
7.; Matt, xxiv., 29.); that spittle contains a charm to cure
blindness and other maladies (John ix., 6, 7.; Mark vii.,
33&ndash;35.; viii., 23, 24.); and that the stars exercise an
influence on the lot of our life (Judges v., 20).&nbsp; But to
enumerate all the instances of contrariety between Scripture and
science would occupy more than all the pages of the present
pamphlet; suffice it to say, that every false notion of the age
is endorsed as an inspired fact, and no single error is
corrected, or new truth brought to light.&nbsp; We must now leave
this part of our subject and proceed to the next division.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Part</span> II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SCRIPTURE IRRECONCILABLE WITH HUMAN
EXPERIENCE.</span></h2>
<p>It is not our intention to dwell at any length upon what are
termed the miracles of Scripture.&nbsp; Of course they are
contrary to experience, but then they are acknowledged miracles,
and those who believe such things possible satisfy their minds by
the persuasion that He who made the laws of nature can suspend
them at will, or can introduce some new factor at need to bring
about preternatural results.</p>
<p>Thus, if any one were to object to the statement made in the
Book of Numbers (xxii., 28.) respecting the ass of the Prophet of
Pethor, which spoke like a man, and knew the will of Jehovah
better than his master, the answer would be, the Lord, who made
the ass, could make it talk also.&nbsp; Again, if any one were to
say that Peter could no more walk on the <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>sea than any
other man, the reply would be, that Jesus was a divine being, and
sustained his rash disciple by His omnipotent power.&nbsp; So, if
anyone were to demur to the chariot and horses which fetched
Elijah from the banks of the Jordan, and carried him through the
air to that mysterious country called by the Hebrews
&ldquo;heaven,&rdquo; he would be told&mdash;well, I hardly know
what he would be told, but certainly the miracle was
substantially repeated when the crucified but risen Christ
mounted through the air without either chariot or horses, and
followed Elijah to the same mysterious region.</p>
<p>Not a few of the &ldquo;miracles&rdquo; of the Bible appear
quite purportless, mere exhibitions of super-human power; but, as
they are miracles, nothing more can be said.&nbsp; What end could
be answered by that miracle performed by the bones of Elisha,
recorded in the Book of Kings?&nbsp; It is said that the Moabites
were burying a man, and being disturbed, cast the dead body into
the grave of Elisha; but when it touched the bones of the
prophet, it &ldquo;revived and stood upon its feet&rdquo; (2
Kings, xiii., 21).&nbsp; In fact the restoration of life is
certainly the commonest of all miracles.&nbsp; We have the
widow&rsquo;s son restored to life by Elijah; the son of the
widow of Nain; the daughter of Jairus; Lazarus, Jesus, and the
many saints which came out of their graves after the
resurrection, and appeared unto many (Matthew xxvii., 52,
53).&nbsp; Shakespeare was quite mistaken when he spoke of the
grave as &ldquo;that bourne from which no traveller
returns.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many have returned, but what is passing
strange is that none have left any record of the land of shadows,
and no curiosity seems ever to have arisen in any living being to
learn from these resuscitated ones the secrets of the dead.&nbsp;
This certainly is contrary to human experience.&nbsp; If some now
in their graves were to go to London and &ldquo;appear unto
many,&rdquo; they would be beset with questions&mdash;questions
of infinite interest, questions of untold influence; but of all
the numerous dead who came to revisit the earth, not one has left
behind a single item of information, and if we except Lazarus and
Jesus, not even the name of anyone has escaped.&nbsp; Some are
called &ldquo;saints;&rdquo; but were these saints taken from
Paradise, and sent to live again in this &ldquo;vale of
tears?&rdquo;&nbsp; One was a Moabite, was he snatched from the
&ldquo;burning lake&rdquo; to live a new life and die a second
time in battle?&nbsp; It is past finding out; and truly so
contrary to experience, so altogether strange, so objectless, so
incredible, that those who relate such things must bear the
responsibility.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>But if
several of the scripture &ldquo;miracles&rdquo; are mere wanton
exhibitions of super-human power, not a few others are puerile in
the extreme.&nbsp; Witness that of Elijah beating the Jordan with
his cloak to make himself a passage across the river (2 Kings,
ii., 8), a &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; repeated by Elisha, after the
ascent of the Tishbite (2 Kings, ii., 14).&nbsp; Witness the tale
told of Elisha respecting the woodman&rsquo;s axe: The woodman
dropped his axe in the river, and Elisha attracted the iron head
to the surface of the water, merely by &ldquo;casting a stick
into the river&rdquo; (2 Kings, vi., 6).&nbsp; Witness the petty
wrath of the Shunamite against the children of Bethel.&nbsp;
These thoughtless children mocked him, saying, &ldquo;Go up,
bald-pate!&rdquo; and the enraged prophet &ldquo;cursed the
children in the name of the Lord,&rdquo; when, lo! &ldquo;two
she-bears out of the wood tare forty-and-two of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In regard to Elisha, however, it must be said
that his miracles outnumber all the rest of the miracles of the
Old Testament put together, and they are none of them free from
serious objection.</p>
<p>The whole argument generally advanced in support of the
miracles of Jesus is singularly weak.&nbsp; It is said that
miracles were needful to show that Jesus was the &ldquo;Sent of
God;&rdquo; that the working of miracles is the seal of the
Almighty to the credentials of Christ, as Nicodemus pleaded (John
iii., 2), &ldquo;No one can do these miracles which thou doest,
except God be with him,&rdquo; and Christ himself endorsed the
same plea when he said to the disbelieving Jews, &ldquo;Believe
me for my works&rsquo; sake&rdquo; (John xiv., 11).&nbsp; It is
notorious that false prophets, and even Satan himself, are said
to be workers of miracles.&nbsp; It is said that miracles are
performed to deceive and lead astray, as well as to convince and
lead to God.&nbsp; In fact miracles prove nothing&mdash;neither
mission from God, nor approval of God, nor the truth of a
doctrine, nor the power of God working in the person who performs
them.&nbsp; They are restricted to the Jews, and nobody knows
anything of the historians who have avouched them.&nbsp; Thus the
great miracle workers of the Old Testament were Elijah and
Elisha; but no one knows who wrote the Books of Kings, which
describe their wonderful works, nor whether those records were
compiled before or after the Captivity.&nbsp; The miracles of
Christ are recorded in four Gospels, and who were the authors of
these memorials?&nbsp; Luke was no eye-witness&mdash;he himself
acknowledges that his Gospel was compiled from several existing
ones (i., 1&ndash;4); but we are nowhere told by what guiding
power he made his selection, nor why his compilation is better <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>or more
worthy of credit than the originals.&nbsp; Mark, like Luke, was
no apostle, and no one knows who he was, when he wrote, or where
his Gospel was written.&nbsp; The very fact that he was the John
Mark referred to in the Acts (xii., 25) is a mere conjecture, and
even if admitted would not prove that he was one of those who
&ldquo;companied&rdquo; with the apostles from the baptism to the
resurrection.&nbsp; The Fourth Gospel, like the First Epistle of
John, is notoriously doubtful, as Bretschneider has shown in his
&ldquo;Probabilia;&rdquo; parts are certainly spurious, and the
whole seems to belong to the latter half of the second century.
<a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; We are, therefore, reduced to one
Gospel&mdash;that of Matthew&mdash;and even of this it may be
said, that no one knows whether it was written in Greek or
Hebrew, for no one has seen the original.&nbsp; It is certain
that parts of our present text are interpolations, and although
it would appear that Matthew wrote what is termed the
&ldquo;Logia&rdquo; (or sayings of Christ), it is far from
certain that the &ldquo;Logia&rdquo; is the same as our First
Gospel.&nbsp; The fact seems to be this: that Matthew noted down
the discourses and parables of Christ; and unknown authors from
time to time added to the original work, till ultimately it
assumed its present form and proportions.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that our present canon of the New
Testament was not established till the year 494; the canon
recognised at the council of Laodicea (360&ndash;4) repudiated
the Book of Revelations.&nbsp; The primitive Christians never
refer to any book of the New Testament, and few quotations from
it were made by the apostolic fathers.&nbsp; It is not till the
close of the second century that we meet with any definite and
distinct mention of New Testament Scriptures at all.&nbsp;
Eusebius recognises as canonical books the four Gospels and Acts,
the Epistles of Paul, and the first Epistles of John and Peter;
but he considers the rest of the books as doubtful; and speaks of
others as equally worthy of credit or rather discredit, such as
the Acts of Paul, the Book of the Shepherd [Hermas], the Kerugma
of Peter, the Epistle of Barnabas, the Clementine Epistles, the
Doctrines of the Apostles, and the Gospel of the Hebrews; all
these, except the first are mentioned by Iren&aelig;us, Clement
of Alexandria, and Origen, on whose authority our selection of
Canonical New Testament Scriptures mainly depends.</p>
<p>It is not a little strange that none of the books cited by the
authors of the Bible as their authority form any part of our <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>canonical
Scriptures.&nbsp; Thus Joshua (x., 13) and the prophet Samuel (2
bk., i., 18) refer to the &ldquo;Book of Jasher;&rdquo; Moses
(Nos. xxi., 14) refers to the &ldquo;Book of the Wars;&rdquo; the
Chronicles refer to the &ldquo;Book of Nathan the Prophet,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Vision of Isaiah,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Vision of Iddo the
Seer,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Book of Shemaiah the Prophet,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Book of Iddo concerning Genealogies,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Lamentations of Jeremiah for king Josiah,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Story [history] of Iddo&rdquo; (2 Chron., ix., 29; xii.,
15; xiii., 22; xxxii., 32; xxxv., 25); the writer of the first
book of Kings (xiv., 19, 29) to the &ldquo;Diary of the Kings of
Judah,&rdquo; and to another of the &ldquo;Kings of
Israel;&rdquo; <a name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a> in 1 Kings iv., 29&ndash;33, we have
mention of several works of Solomon unknown to us; in Acts, vii.,
42, allusion is made to the &ldquo;Book of the Prophets;&rdquo;
Paul refers more than once to his &ldquo;own Gospel&rdquo; (Rom.,
ii., 16; xvi., 25); <a name="citation20b"></a><a
href="#footnote20b" class="citation">[20b]</a> and Jude (14) to
the &ldquo;Book of Enoch,&rdquo; none of which form any part of
our Bible.</p>
<p>In regard to the New Testament the number of books professing
to set forth the words and deeds of Christ was very numerous,
even when the Gospel of Luke was compiled, and when the canon was
fixed by &ldquo;uninspired&rdquo; authority, the claimants were
legion.&nbsp; The present selection was made by persons wholly
incompetent to weigh evidence, and their only rule was what they
arbitrarily judged to be orthodox, which, of course, means in
agreement with their own religious opinions.&nbsp; This being the
case, on what does the testimony of miracles rest? certainly not
on eye-witnesses, not even on the authority of
contemporaries.&nbsp; Paley says the men suffered persecution and
even death in proof of their belief, but Paley has no ground for
this assertion: first, because he knows nothing about any of the
four Evangelists, and cannot tell whether they suffered
persecution or not; and, secondly, he cannot know whether the
names attached to these evangelists <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>are real names or not.&nbsp; But
allowing Paley&rsquo;s assertion to be true, what is gained by
it?&nbsp; It is by no means true that a willingness to suffer is
a proof of truth.&nbsp; It may be a proof of obstinacy, of
conviction, or even of cowardice, but can be no proof of
truth.&nbsp; A boy who has stolen from a schoolfellow will often
suffer greatly to maintain a lie; indeed the expression,
&ldquo;it was worthy a better cause,&rdquo; is a proverbial proof
that men suffer and labour for the wrong as well as for the
right.&nbsp; Allowing, therefore, that the early disciples did
suffer, it proves nothing, and certainly it will not prove the
truth of the gospel narratives.&nbsp; It is now admitted by all
biblical scholars that large parts of our Gospels are
interpolations, some of the epistles are known to be spurious,
and probably the only part of the New Testament at all worthy of
credit is that taken from the &ldquo;Logia,&rdquo; or sayings of
Christ.&nbsp; But we have run somewhat from our subject.&nbsp; In
stating that Scripture contradicts experience, we would wholly
set aside miracles, and limit our examples to matters more
tangible.&nbsp; Our first observations shall be respecting the
Mosaic account of prehistoric man.</p>
<h3>(1.)&nbsp; <i>The Biblical prehistoric man not reconcilable
with historic experience</i>.</h3>
<p>The writer of the Book of Genesis represents Cain as a tiller
of the ground.&nbsp; His son was Enoch, who built a city called
Enoch; and during the lifetime of Adam lived Jabal, Jubal, and
Tubal-Cain, all sons of Lamech.&nbsp; The first of these was the
&ldquo;father of such as dwell in tents,&rdquo; the second the
inventor of both &ldquo;harp and organ,&rdquo; and the third a
forger of &ldquo;every artifice in brass and iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Flood came and swept away the whole race of man except the
arkites; but the grandsons of Noah were Mizraim, Cush, and
Canaan, sons of Ham; Asshur, Elam, Lud, Madai, Javan, and Tiras,
the founders of the Egyptians, Cushites, and Canaanites, the
Assyrians, Elamites or Persians, Lydians, Medes, Ionians, and
Thracians; while Canaan and Cush gave birth to Sidon, founder of
the Sidonians, and Nimrod the despot, who founded a vast empire,
&ldquo;the beginning of which was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calah
the great city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we are introduced to agriculture from the very beginning:
Adam tilled the garden of Eden; Cain, the first earth-born man,
was a farmer; and Noah, the representative of the new race, was
the planter of a vineyard.&nbsp; While Adam <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>still lived
we have tents invented, musical instruments, and &ldquo;every
artifice in brass and iron;&rdquo; while Noah was still alive we
have the fathers born of all the great empires, which have to the
present day perpetuated their names.&nbsp; Is this
credible?&nbsp; Is it not rather of a piece with the old system
of taking the names of places, cities, and empires, and
concocting personages to account for them?&nbsp; We all know that
the ancient Greeks and Romans did so; we all know that Geoffrey
of Monmouth has done as much for our own country.&nbsp; Thus
Britain, Cornwall, Devon, and so on, suggested the mythical
heroes, Bryt, Corin, and Debon.&nbsp; The people or place suggest
the name, and the founder is a mere myth.&nbsp; It is wholly
irreconcilable with all the experience of geology and history,
that the very first families of the earth should be founders of
empires, inventors of brass and iron works, tents and musical
instruments, tillage and vine dressing; in fact, the men
immediately following Adam and Noah were like those which Moses
had seen in Egypt, and he never dreamt of a more primitive race.
<a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p>Now, what says science and history of prehistoric man?&nbsp;
The earliest traces of which we have authentic record prove that
men lived in caves, not cities like that of Enoch; they lived by
hunting and fishing, not by agriculture and breeding sheep, like
Cain and Abel; far less by vine-dressing, like Noah.&nbsp; They
had small hands, for the implements found give room for only
three fingers of an ordinary man; their skulls were long, and
their legs more nearly allied to the monkey type.</p>
<p>There is no trace in the pal&aelig;olithic period of any such
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>human
beings as Moses describes; none even in the next period, styled
by Sir John Lubbock the later or &ldquo;polished stone
age,&rdquo; like Tubal-Cain, a &ldquo;worker in brass and
iron,&rdquo; none like Jubal, who could &ldquo;handle the harp
and organ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Long, long before the &ldquo;age of
bronze&rdquo; dawned upon the earth, ages upon ages of a ruder
and still ruder race lived and passed away; a race whose
instruments were stone, first rough and subsequently smooth and
polished.</p>
<p>It is impossible in the present state of human knowledge to
determine what length of time elapsed before the
pal&aelig;olithic age glided into the neolithic, but it must have
been very great, and even then the rude life which presents its
records to observation shows that man was far removed from the
Mosaic description of the immediate children of Cain and
grandsons of Noah.&nbsp; There were no builders of cities, no
founders of empires; but as we ascend higher and higher from the
drift, we trace a certain knowledge in pottery and a goodly skill
in working up stone into warlike and other implements.&nbsp; The
gallery graves of the earth, even in the latest age of the
neolithic period, resemble Eskimo huts more than regular cities
and palaces, and it is not till we arrive at the evening of this
long day that we discover any trace of herdsmen and tillers of
the soil.</p>
<p>All this vast history of man finds no place in the Book of
Genesis.&nbsp; As the writer of that book knew nothing of the
rocks and their mighty revelations, he knew nothing of man but in
the state of civilised society.&nbsp; The one and the other are
wholly irreconcilable with the logic of facts, and deserve no
higher place than the wild legends of India and China, Greece,
Rome, and our own Britain.&nbsp; What would Sir John Lubbock say
to the legend: that Noah the first man, so to speak, was a
vinedresser; that within a century his offspring were building a
tower, the top of which was to reach the skies, a tower described
as a most finished and extraordinary work of art?&nbsp; What
would he say to the statement that primitive man, long before the
neolithic or even pal&aelig;olithic period produced the founders
of such grand empires as Babylon, Assyria, Persia, and old
Greece?&nbsp; It is an insult to our understanding, a
contradiction to our eyes, a gainsaying of the infallible records
of the rocks, to place credence in such legends.&nbsp; They are
palpably untrue, wholly impossible, and as wholly irreconcilable
with history and the experience of facts. <a

<h3><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>(2.)&nbsp; <i>The Scripture accounts of the increase of
man wholly irreconcilable with experience and history</i>.</h3>
<p>We shall confine our remarks under this head to three
instances&mdash;the builders of Babel, the age of Abraham, and
the Exodus from Egypt.&nbsp; Other instances will doubtless recur
to the reader, but the scope of argument would be much the same
in every example.</p>
<p>The builders of Babel are placed about 100 years after the
flood.&nbsp; The general impression left by the Bible account is,
that the race of man was pretty numerous.&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole
earth,&rdquo; says the writer, &ldquo;was of one language and one
speech.&rdquo;&nbsp; This would not be said of a clan or a
nation, but must refer to several nations.&nbsp; It would be
absurd to call Sussex or Kent &ldquo;the whole earth,&rdquo; nor
less so to say it was all of &ldquo;one language and one
speech.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be scarcely less impertinent to say
all England, or all France, spoke one and the same
language.&nbsp; But to say that all Germany, Russia, Spain,
Italy, England, and Sweden, spoke one language and used one
speech would be far otherwise.&nbsp; When, therefore, the
historian makes the statement that &ldquo;the whole earth was of
one language and one speech,&rdquo; he virtually says there were
several different nations, and a good round number of
peoples.&nbsp; The writer continues&mdash;&ldquo;And it came to
pass as they (?) journeyed from the east they found a plain in
the land of Shinar and dwelt there,&rdquo; and they &ldquo;made
bricks&rdquo; (!) and used &ldquo;slime for mortar,&rdquo; and
said one to another, &ldquo;Let us build a city, and a tower
whose top may reach to heaven;&rdquo; but the Lord scattered them
abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth. [Gen. xi.,
1&ndash;9.]</p>
<p>Now, at the abatement of the flood the earth contained just
four men and four women.&nbsp; According &ldquo;to
experience,&rdquo; a population under the most favourable
circumstances possible may double itself in 25 years; <a
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a> but let us take the increase of the
prolific race of Abraham, which, according to Scripture
authority, doubled itself in 20 years [Gen. xlvi., 27].&nbsp;
This would make the entire population of the earth at the
dispersion <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>256 souls.&nbsp; Suppose half males and half females, we
get 128 of each sex, and supposing one-third to be adults and
two-thirds children, we have somewhat less than 43 adult males,
and this was the entire population of grown men in &ldquo;the
whole earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; These 43 men &ldquo;were all of one
language and one speech.&rdquo;&nbsp; These 43 men &ldquo;made
bricks,&rdquo; and said one to another, &ldquo;let us build a
city and a tower whose top shall reach to heaven,&rdquo; and the
speech of these 43 was confounded, and the two score and three
were &ldquo;scattered over the whole earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing
of comment need be added.</p>
<p>The next event we would advert to is the period of
Abraham.&nbsp; There were then several large empires and populous
nations.&nbsp; Egypt had its regular court and standing army;
Nineveh was older still; China and India were certainly advanced
in organisation.&nbsp; We read of nine kings who made war
&ldquo;in the vale of Siddim, which is the Salt Sea&rdquo; [Gen.
xiv.]; some of the Greek states, as Argos and Attica, were
founded; and Etruria must have been in its hey-day.&nbsp; This
would demand a population of some hundreds of millions at the
least; but what was the fact, according to the Bible reading?</p>
<p>Noah was scarcely dead when Abraham was born; some calculate
that he had been dead two years, while others think the two lives
overlapped each other.&nbsp; As Noah was 950 years old at death,
and 600 when he entered the ark, we are not left to conjecture
respecting the interval, which, of course, was 350 years.&nbsp;
There were four men and four women when the flood ceased; and
suppose the increase to be the extraordinary one of doubling five
times in a century, we have 256 souls at the end of the 1st
century, 8,192 at the close of the 2nd, and one-and-a-half
million at the death of Noah; say two millions at the birth of
Abraham, a population inferior to that of Lancashire, and only
two-thirds that of London.&nbsp; These two millions are supposed
to have furnished forth several large empires, most of which
would require more than the whole number.&nbsp; Again we leave
the subject without adding a word of comment.</p>
<p>The number of the Exodus has already been considered in No. 8
of this series.&nbsp; It is given by the author of the book as
600,000 &ldquo;fighting men&rdquo; or adult males; and if the
women equalled the men, and the children were two to one, we have
600,000 adults of each sex, and 1,200,000 children of each sex,
somewhat more than three-and-a-half millions, say three
millions.&nbsp; The increase of 70 souls in 215 years, although
oppressed by <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>taskmasters, and although for 80 years of the time the
decree of Pharaoh to put to death every male infant at birth, was
supposed to be in force.&nbsp; Taking the same rate as that given
above, the 70 at the close of the first century would have been
2,240, and 124,540 at the time of the Exodus.&nbsp; Allowing the
children to be twice as many as the adults, this would give us
6,703 as the number of &ldquo;fighting men,&rdquo; or, in round
numbers, 6,000 instead of 600,000.</p>
<p>Presuming the Bible text to be correct, the three millions led
by Moses into the wilderness would require daily for food 3,000
oxen and 30,000 sheep, that is allowing half-a-pound of food per
head.&nbsp; Of course meat might be replaced by bread, but it
would not decrease the difficulty to have corn to carry across
the Red Sea.<a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a>&nbsp; As it was 45 days before manna
was supplied, the fugitives must have driven before them
1,135,000 sheep, and 135,000 oxen.&nbsp; Hence there were three
million of men, women, and children, a mixed multitude of camp
followers, more than a million sheep, and 135,000 head of oxen to
lead in flight across the Red Sea, with the horsemen and chariots
of Pharaoh in pursuit.&nbsp; Of course, on the reduced scale of
6,000 instead of 600,000, all this would be divided by 100; and
although there would still remain above a thousand oxen and
eleven thousand sheep, the numbers would be much more manageable;
but the writer of the Book of Exodus is responsible for the
larger numbers, and with them only are we concerned. <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a></p>
<h3>(3.)&nbsp; <i>The armies of the Jews</i>, <i>and the numbers
slain in war irreconcilable with experience and history</i>.</h3>
<p>Akin to the above is the extravagant numbers given in
Scripture of the fighting men mustered on several occasions by
the petty kingdom of Israel before it was divided, and of <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>the still
more petty states of Judah and Israel after the revolt of the ten
tribes.&nbsp; The whole undivided kingdom was nominally 60 miles
broad, and 140 miles long, less than the county of
Yorkshire.&nbsp; Much of this never came into the power of the
Hebrews, and more than three-fourths was desert.&nbsp; After the
division each kingdom was about the size of Norfolk and Suffolk.
<a name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a></p>
<p>Let us first take two examples of the undivided kingdom.&nbsp;
At the close of David&rsquo;s reign, the number of fighting men
is given (2 Samuel, xxiv., 9) as 1,300,000; and, after the
revolt, Abijah, grandson of Solomon, is said to have headed an
army of 400,000 chosen men against Jeroboam, who had 800,000 men
under him.&nbsp; This gives 1,200,000 fighting men in two petty
kingdoms, the aggregate of which was less than the principality
of Wales.&nbsp; But what will be said of the sequel? the 400,000
men under Abijah slew 500,000 of the enemy! with swords and
bows!! <a name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a></p>
<p>The late unhappy, but gigantic contest between Germany and
France, makes us pretty familiar with war, the size of armies,
and the number slain by the most murderous instruments ever used
by man.&nbsp; Suppose Gambetta had said 400,000 Frenchmen had
slain 500,000 Prussians, should we believe it?&nbsp; Suppose he
had said that 500,000 out of 800,000 had fallen by the sword,
should we believe it?&nbsp; It is wholly irreconcilable with
experience, and most incredible.</p>
<p>Come we now to an example or two of the divided kingdom.&nbsp;
The kingdom of Judah was about equal in area to the two <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>counties of
Norfolk and Suffolk, but what are we told of its army?</p>
<p>[2 Chronicles, xiv., 8.]&nbsp; Asa, grandson of Rehoboam, King
of Judah, had 300,000 heavy-armed troops, and 280,000
light-armed, nearly 600,000, and &ldquo;all mighty men of
valour!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>[2 Chronicles, xvii., 14&ndash;18.]&nbsp; Jehoshaphat, son of
Asa, had an army of 1,160,000 soldiers, &ldquo;all mighty men of
valour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>[2 Chronicles, xxv., 5, 6.]&nbsp; Amaziah, King of Judah, had
300,000 &ldquo;choice men, handling spear and shield, above 20
years old,&rdquo; and a mercenary contingent of 100,000
Israelites, which he hired for 100 talents of silver
(&pound;34,200).</p>
<p>[2 Chronicles, xxvi., 12&ndash;13.]&nbsp; Uzziah&rsquo;s army
consisted of 307,500 trained soldiers &ldquo;under 2,600 chief
officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No such armies as these correspond with our experience.&nbsp;
Compare the armies of Europe with those of these petty princes,
and see how wholly irreconcilable are these statements to the
plain unvarnished statements of dry facts.</p>
<p>We have given one instance of slaughter under Abijah, king of
Judah, and will now add one example of Pekah, king of Israel.</p>
<p>[2 Chronicles, xxviii., 6, 8.]&nbsp; Pekah is said to have
slain in one day 120,000 valiant men of Judah, and to have
carried away captive 200,000 souls, with much spoil.</p>
<p>Mr. Cardwell proposes to raise our army to 108,000 men.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says <i>The Times</i>, &ldquo;is more than
twice as large as the largest army ever taken into battle by
Wellington, and three times as large as [the English contingent
of] that with which he conquered at Waterloo.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
would <i>The Times</i> say of the armies of Judah and Israel?</p>
<p>Where there is no motive for exaggeration the numbers are much
more modest.&nbsp; Thus the army of Sennacherib, king of Assyria,
no doubt, was very formidable, but it dwindles to nothing
compared to the gigantic armies of Judah and Israel.&nbsp; The
army of the &ldquo;great king&rdquo; amounted only to 185,000 men
(2 Kings, xix., 35); if Judah could muster its million or even
half million of valiant men, all in the prime of life, there was
no need of a miracle to lay the invaders in the dust.</p>
<p>We will conclude this part of our subject with a few examples
of incredible statements, which cannot be classed under the
foregoing heads.</p>
<h3>(4.)&nbsp; <i>Incredible Marvels or Statements</i>.</h3>
<h4>Joshua, vi., 20.</h4>
<p>A procession of priests is said to have walked round the
fortifications of Jericho, and when they blew with their trumpets
&ldquo;the walls fell down flat.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Judges, iii., 31.</h4>
<p>Shamgar, we are told, slew 600 of the Philistines with an
ox-goad.&nbsp; Doeg, the Edomite (1 Sam., xxii., 18), &ldquo;with
his own hand,&rdquo; slew in one day 85 persons &ldquo;who wore a
linen ephod,&rdquo; besides &ldquo;all the men and women,
children and sucklings, asses, oxen, and sheep,&rdquo; of the
town of Nob.&nbsp; Abishai, David&rsquo;s brother-in-law (2 Sam.,
xxiii., 18), slew 300 with his own spear; but Adino, the Eznite,
(v. 8), slew with his own hand in one battle 800 men (!)&nbsp;
Impossible as these statements undoubtedly are, they dwindle into
insignificance before the exploit attributed to Samson (Judges,
xv., 16), who, &ldquo;with a new jawbone of an ass,&rdquo; slew
1000 Philistines (!!).&nbsp; A thousand men laid low by one with
no other instrument than an ass&rsquo;s jaw (!!); but the marvel
does not end here, for when Samson had thrown away his weapon,
&ldquo;there came water from a hollow place in the jaw,&rdquo;
and the thirsty Samson drank thereof to revive his fainting
spirit.</p>
<h4>Ruth, iv., 21, 22.</h4>
<p>Boaz was great grandfather of David, and the mother of Boaz
was Rahab the harlot.&nbsp; In this brief space is to be crowded
all the events recorded in the book of Joshua, the book of
Judges, the book of Ruth, and part of the First Book of Samuel, a
period of about 400 years.</p>
<p>Take a familiar case.&nbsp; George III. was grandfather of our
Queen, and he was grandson of George II.&nbsp; This exactly
corresponds with the text; but 400 years would carry us back not
to George II., but to Edward IV.&nbsp; What would be thought of
an historian who said that Edward IV. was the father of Queen
Victoria&rsquo;s great grandfather?&nbsp; But the statement
referred to is identical thereto.</p>
<h4>1 Kings, xx., 30.</h4>
<p>We are informed by the writer of the book of Kings that some
of the routed host of Benhadad fled to Aphek, when a wall fell,
and by its fall crushed to death 27,000 of them (!).</p>
<h4>2 Kings, i., 9&ndash;12.</h4>
<p>Elijah is said to have brought fire from heaven by his bare
word, and by this means were consumed two companies sent to
arrest him, each company consisting of 50 men.</p>
<h4>Jonah.</h4>
<p>The prophet Jonah is said to have been swallowed by a
whale.&nbsp; Presuming it possible for a whale to swallow a man,
no man could live three days and three nights in the belly of a
fish, and then be cast by it on dry land.</p>
<h4><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Deuteronomy, viii., 4.</h4>
<p>Moses tells us that in forty years&rsquo; time the
&ldquo;raiment of his three million wanderers&rdquo; waxed not
old, and though marching all that time about the hot desert,
&ldquo;their feet did not swell&rdquo; from the scorching
sand.</p>
<h4>1 Chronicles, xix., 6, 7.</h4>
<p>Hanun of Ammon sent 1000 talents of silver (&pound;342,000) to
Mesopotamia, for the hire of 32,000 chariots (!!).&nbsp; Is not
this wholly at variance with sober history?&nbsp; Is it
credible?&nbsp; In the parallel account given in 2 Sam. x., 6,
there is no mention of these 32,000 chariots of war.</p>
<h4>2 Chronicles, xiv., 9.</h4>
<p>It is stated that Mareshah, in Judea, was invaded in the reign
of Asa, by a million Ethiopians and 300 chariots (!!).</p>
<p>These are a few specimens of the unhistoric character of the
history of the Old Testament.&nbsp; We will add one or two
instances of the equally incredible statements of the wealth of
Bible Kings.</p>
<h4>2 Samuel, viii., 7; 1 Chronicles, xviii., 7.</h4>
<p>Hadarezer&rsquo;s army is represented to have been furnished
with shields of gold.&nbsp; We read occasionally of some rich
prince, like Glaucus, having golden armour, but never of a whole
army being equipped with golden shields.&nbsp; We are told also
that Solomon made 300 shields of gold for the temple; but these
were mere ornamental plates, &ldquo;3 pounds of gold went to one
shield,&rdquo; the value of these was not above half-a-million of
English money, they were mere playthings compared to those in
Hadarezer&rsquo;s army (1 Kings x. 17).</p>
<h4>2 Chronicles, vii., 5.</h4>
<p>At the dedication of the temple, we are informed that Solomon
&ldquo;offered in sacrifice 22,000 oxen and 120,000
sheep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Compare this with the sacrifice of Hezekiah,
&ldquo;70 bullocks, 100 rams, and 200 lambs&rdquo; (2 Chron.
xxix., 32).</p>
<h4>1 Chronicles, xxii., 14.</h4>
<p>This profusion of wealth, unexampled as it may be, is wholly
eclipsed by king David, who laid up for Jehovah about 7,000
millions sterling (!!); that is to say, a million talents of
silver and 100,000 talents of gold; in English money 342 millions
sterling in silver, and 5,500 millions <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>sterling in gold.&nbsp; Truly the
principality of Wales could never compete in wealth with this
Pactolus of a kingdom! <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; Come we now to
our last division.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Part</span> III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BIBLE IRRECONCILABLE WITH
ITSELF.</span></h2>
<p>We shall subdivide this head into two parts.&nbsp; Under the
first we will bring forward biblical blunders or misstatements,
and under the second positive contradictions.</p>
<p>The two former parts of this paper were concerned with the
dogma of <i>general</i> inspiration; this part looks to the
<i>verbal</i> inspiration of the Bible.&nbsp; There surely can be
no safe mean between verbal inspiration and no inspiration at
all.&nbsp; Give up the verbal inspiration and the wedge is
introduced which must inevitably destroy the whole dogma; but if
one single blunder can be pointed out, that one blunder will be
fatal to the notion of verbal inspiration.</p>
<p>As the errors of Scripture are very numerous, nothing like an
exhaustive list can be included in a small pamphlet like this,
but every end will be served by the instances subjoined, which we
have arranged in groups, for the purpose of preserving something
like order.</p>
<h3>(<i>a</i>.)&nbsp; <i>Historical Errors</i>.</h3>
<h4>2 Sam. xxi., 8.</h4>
<p>The first example we would bring forward refers to
Saul&rsquo;s daughter Michal, who is called in the book of Samuel
&ldquo;the wife of Adriel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, Adriel did not marry
Michal (Saul&rsquo;s youngest daughter), but Merab.&nbsp; Michal
married first David and then Phalti.</p>
<p>This will be evident by a reference to 1 Sam. xviii., 19, 27,
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>where it
is said: &ldquo;When Merab, Saul&rsquo;s daughter, should have
been given to David, she was given to Adriel to wife.&nbsp; And
Michal, Saul&rsquo;s daughter, loved David; and Saul gave him
Michal, his daughter, to wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the persecution, David fled from the presence of the
king, and Saul then &ldquo;gave Michal to another husband, whose
name was Phalti&rdquo; (1 Sam. xxv., 44).&nbsp; It is, therefore,
an historical error to call Michal the &ldquo;wife of
Adriel.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>2 Chron. xv., 17.</h4>
<p>Speaking of Asa, king of Judah, the chronicler says, his
&ldquo;heart was perfect all his days, [but] the high places were
not taken away out of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where Israel obviously
ought to be Judah.&nbsp; The kingdom of David was divided into
Judah and Israel, and Asa had nothing whatever to do with the
latter.</p>
<p>A similar blunder occurs in 2 Chron. xxi., 3, where
Jehoshaphat is called &ldquo;the King of Israel,&rdquo; whereas
he was King of Judah, as will appear evident from 1 Kings, xxii.,
41, where it is said &ldquo;Jehoshaphat, son of Asa, began to
reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, king of
Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See also</i> 2 Chron. xxiii., 2.)</p>
<p>And again, 2 Chron. xxviii., 27, we have the same error
repeated; for, speaking of Ahaz, king of Judah, the writer says,
&ldquo;they buried him in Jerusalem, but brought him not into the
sepulchres of the Kings of Israel,&rdquo; meaning the kings of
Judah.</p>
<h4>2 Chron. xxi., 12.</h4>
<p>Here we have a very glaring error.&nbsp; Elijah is represented
as sending a threatening letter to Jehoram, king of Judah; but
the Tishbite had been &ldquo;taken up to heaven in a chariot of
fire&rdquo; during the reign of Jehoshaphat, Jehoram&rsquo;s
father; and the prophet alluded to should be Elisha, and not
Elijah.</p>
<p>The blunder arises from a confusion in the mind of the
chronicler between Jehoram king of Israel, and Jehoram king of
Judah.&nbsp; This will be understood by turning to 2 Kings,
viii., 20, where the revolt of the Edomites, which preceded the
&ldquo;threatening letter,&rdquo; is narrated.&nbsp; The
translation of Elijah is given six chapters further back, viz. 2
Kings, ii., 11.</p>
<h4>Matt, xxvii., 9.</h4>
<p>The writer is speaking of Judas, who returned the money
casting it down before the priests.&nbsp; This money was used for
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>the
purchase of a field to bury strangers in, and the Evangelist
adds: &ldquo;Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy
the prophet, saying: &lsquo;They took the 30 pieces of silver . .
. and gave them for the potter&rsquo;s field.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
These are not the words of Jeremiah at all, but of Zechariah.
(xi., 12, 13.)</p>
<h4>Mark ii., 26.</h4>
<p>Here we have an historical error made by Christ himself.&nbsp;
The disciples had been blamed for plucking ears of corn on the
Sabbath day; whereupon Jesus retorted&mdash;&ldquo;Have ye not
read what David did when he had need and was an hungered . . .
how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar, the
High Priest, and did eat the shew bread?&rdquo;&nbsp; The High
Priest alluded to was not Abiathar, but Ahimelech.&nbsp; The
account will be found 1 Sam. xxi., 1&ndash;6.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
came David to Nob, to Ahimelech the [High] Priest . . . and said
to him . . . give me [the] five loaves [under thine hand] . .
.&nbsp; And the priest answered . . . &lsquo;There is no common
bread under mine hand, but [only] the hallowed bread, . . .&nbsp;
So the priest gave him [the] hallowed bread.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Acts, vii., 15, 16.</h4>
<p>Here again we have an unpardonable historical error.&nbsp; The
writer says: &ldquo;So Jacob died, and our fathers, and were
carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham
bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was not Abraham, but Jacob.&nbsp; Abraham bought of Ephron the
Hittite, the field of Machpelah (<i>see</i> Gen. xxiii., 16,
&amp;c.); it was Jacob who bought the &ldquo;parcel of a field at
the hand of the children of Hamor [Emmor], Shechem&rsquo;s
father, for 100 pieces of money.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Gen. xxxiii., 19;
and Joshua, xxiv., 32.)</p>
<h3>(<i>b</i>.)&nbsp; <i>Erroneous figures</i>.</h3>
<p>These are so numerous it is universally allowed that no
dependence is to be placed upon them; but the instances subjoined
are sufficiently striking, and in any book except the Bible would
be termed errors.</p>
<h4>Joshua, xv., 21&ndash;32.</h4>
<p>Here the writer says that twenty-nine cities towards the coast
of Edom were awarded to the tribe of Judah, and he <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>gives the
names; but if any one will count the names set down he will find
they amount to thirty-eight.</p>
<p>The enumeration occupies twelve verses, two of which contain
four names, and the other ten verses three each.</p>
<h4>Judges, xii., 6.</h4>
<p>This is a very gross error or exaggeration.&nbsp; The writer
says that 42,000 Ephraimites were slain at the passage of the
Jordan, because they &ldquo;could not frame to pronounce&rdquo;
the word Shibboleth aright.&nbsp; By turning to the census
(Numbers, xxvi., 37) it will be seen that the entire population
of the tribe was only 32,500, and by comparing this census with
the previous one it will be further seen that the tribe of
Ephraim was on the decrease, but even in its palmiest days it
never amounted to 42,000.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> Numbers, i., 33.)</p>
<h4>2 Sam., xv., 7.</h4>
<p>Here we have the tale of Absalom&rsquo;s revolt.&nbsp; Having
murdered his half-brother Amnon, he fled to Gesher, the court of
his grandfather; but after the lapse of three years he was
permitted to return to Jerusalem, on condition that he kept away
from court for two years.&nbsp; At the expiration of this time he
became reconciled to the aged king, and &ldquo;tarried forty
years,&rdquo; when he revolted.</p>
<p>This of course is a blunder.&nbsp; The whole reign of David
was only forty years, and this was towards its close.&nbsp;
Probably &ldquo;forty years&rdquo; should be forty <i>days</i>,
but the correction is only a guess, and the text is responsible
for the mistake.</p>
<h4>1 Chron., i., 13&ndash;15.</h4>
<p>The First Book of Chronicles begins with a genealogy from Adam
down to David.&nbsp; The subject occupies several chapters, but
any attempt to reconcile the numerous genealogies of Scripture is
quite hopeless.&nbsp; Let any one, for example, take the two
tables of Matthew and Luke, and it will presently appear how
little they correspond; or take the genealogy of Simeon given in
Gen., xlvi., 10, and 1 Chron., iv., 24, and compare them
together; or that of the sons of Benjamin given in Gen., xlvi.,
21; 1 Chron., vii., 6; and 1 Chron., viii., 1.&nbsp; In Genesis
his sons are said to be ten, in Chron., vii., they are three, in
Chron., viii., they are five.</p>
<h4>1 Chron., ii., 14.</h4>
<p>One would have thought that no diversity could possibly exist
respecting David, the favourite king; but what is the <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>fact?&nbsp;
The Bible writers agree neither respecting his father&rsquo;s
family nor his own.</p>
<p>The reference given above states David to be &ldquo;the
seventh son of Jesse;&rdquo; but in 1 Sam., xvi., 10, 11, he is
represented to be the eighth son.&nbsp; The writer says,
&ldquo;Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel; and
Samuel said: Are these all thy children? and (Jesse answered)
there remaineth yet the youngest, and he keepeth the
sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similarly, in regard to the sons of David, compare 1 Chron.,
iii., 6&ndash;8, and 1 Chron., xiv., 5&ndash;7, with 2 Sam., v.,
15&ndash;16.&nbsp; If anyone had known about David one would
suppose that Samuel would have been that man, but Samuel says
only seven sons were born to David in Jerusalem, whereas the
chronicler says he had nine, viz., (1) Ibhar, (2) Elishua, (3)
<span class="smcap">Eliphelet</span>, (4) Nogah, (5) Nepheg, (6)
Japhia (7), Elishama, (8) Eliada, (9) <span
class="smcap">Eliphelet</span>.&nbsp; It will be seen that the
name Eliphelet occurs twice in the Book of Chronicles but only
once in the book of Samuel.&nbsp; The other name omitted by the
prophet is Nogah.</p>
<p>Now we are upon the subject of genealogy we would direct
attention to two other examples.&nbsp; In 1 Chron., iii., 22, we
read that the &ldquo;sons of Shemaiah [were] Hattush, Igeal,
Bariah, Neariah, and Shaphat, six;&rdquo; but only five names are
given, so that &ldquo;six&rdquo; should have been
<i>five</i>.</p>
<p>The other example is 1 Chron., vii., 14&ndash;15, compared
with Numbers, xxvii., 1.&nbsp; The chronicler says: The children
of Manasseh were first Ashriel, and &ldquo;the name of the second
was Zelophehad, who had daughters;&rdquo; but the author of the
book of Numbers says Zelophehad was the &ldquo;son of Hepher, the
son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,&rdquo; and
that no mistake may possibly exist respecting the Zelophehad
referred to, the writer expressly mentions that it was the
Zelophehad who had &ldquo;the daughters.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>See</i>
verse 7.)</p>
<h4>1 Chron., vi., 57&ndash;60.</h4>
<p>Here the chronicler enumerates the cities given to Aaron, and
says: &ldquo;All their cities were 13;&rdquo; but according to
the list subjoined the number should have been eleven.</p>
<h4>2 Chron., xxi., 20.</h4>
<p>We are told that Jehoram at death was 40 years old.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was 32 when he began to reign, and reigned eight
years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next chapter [xxii., 2] we are told that his
son, who immediately succeeded him, was 42 years old when he
began to reign; so that Ahaziah was two years older than his
father.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>What
makes the blunder worse is this: Ahaziah was the youngest of
several children [2 Chron., xxi., 17 <a name="citation36"></a><a
href="#footnote36" class="citation">[36]</a>]; but the blunders
do not end even here, for we are furthermore informed [2 Chron.,
xxii., 8] that Jehu &ldquo;slew the Princes of Judah [even] the
sons of the brethren of Ahaziah,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, the
grandsons of Jehoram.&nbsp; The number thus slain was 42 [2
Kings, x., 13&ndash;14], only the author of the book of Kings
does not call them grandsons, but &ldquo;brethren of
Ahaziah.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let whichever of these records be accepted,
the error is equally palpable.&nbsp; If the princes slain by Jehu
were the brothers of Ahaziah, then Jehoram, who died at the age
of 40, had 43 sons, the youngest of which was 42 years old at his
father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, the princes
referred to were the grandchildren of Jehoram, then had he 42
grandsons at the age of 40.</p>
<h4>2 Chron., xxviii., 7.</h4>
<p>This is another example similar to the one above.&nbsp;
Zichri, we are told, was &ldquo;a mighty man of Ephraim,&rdquo;
and he &ldquo;slew Maaseiah, the son of king Ahaz.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the 1st verse of the chapter we are informed that &ldquo;Ahaz
was 20 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 16
years;&rdquo; so that his age at death was 36, and he was
succeeded by Hezekiah, his son.</p>
<p>The next chapter [2 Chron., xxix, 1] opens
thus&mdash;&ldquo;Hezekiah began to reign when he was 25 years
old;&rdquo; so that Ahaz at the age of 20, had at least two sons,
one of which was grown to man&rsquo;s estate, and the other was
half the age of his father.&nbsp; We read of early marriages, but
it is most unusual for any father to have a son at the early age
of four or five, and it is more likely that the chronicler is in
error than that such an event should be rigidly true.</p>
<h4>2 Chron., xxxiv., 1.</h4>
<p>A similar statement is made respecting Josiah, who had four
sons, and at least two wives before he was 16.&nbsp; His four
sons were Johanan, Jehoiakim, Zedekiah, and Shallum [1 Chron.,
iii., 15].&nbsp; Shallum, his youngest son, succeeded him [Jer.
xxii., 11]; this young man was also called Jehoahaz, if the
author of the book of Chronicles may be relied on [2 Chron.,
xxxvi., 2].</p>
<p>He was 23 years old at his father&rsquo;s death, and as Josiah
died at the age of 39, Shallum was born when his father was 16 [2
Chron., xxxiv., 1].&nbsp; He reigned only three months, and <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>was then
succeeded by Jehoiakim, an elder brother, who was 25 years old [2
Kings, xxiii., 30]; so that Josiah was only 14 when his second
son was born.&nbsp; His eldest son Johanan must have been above
26 years of age, and this would make Josiah under 13 at the birth
of his first-born.</p>
<p>Now, the age of hundreds of persons have been given in the
Bible, but no single example can be found to induce a belief that
the Jews were precocious fathers.&nbsp; We never find it said
that so and so was 4 or 5, 10 or 12 years old, and begat sons and
daughters.&nbsp; The age stated is about the same as with
ourselves, and there is every reason to believe that the
instances referred to above are oversights.</p>
<h4>Ezra i., 7&ndash;11.</h4>
<p>This shall be the last example under this division of our
subject, though far more remains behind than we have here brought
under notice.</p>
<p>In this passage Ezra gives the number of gold and silver
vessels restored by Cyrus.&nbsp; They are the sacred vessels
carried by Nebuchadnezzar into Babylon, and the number restored
is estimated at 5,400; but the articles specified amount to only
2,499.&nbsp; There were 30 gold chargers, and 30 gold basins,
1,000 silver chargers, with 1,000 other vessels in silver, 410
silver basins, and 29 knives.&nbsp; The deficiency, therefore, is
2901.</p>
<p>This miscalculation is sufficiently strange, but the statement
becomes infinitely more astounding when we read the account given
us in the book of Kings respecting the spoliation of these
vessels [2 Kings, xxiv., 13].&nbsp; It is said that
Nebuchadnezzar &ldquo;cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which
Solomon had made.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was in the reign of Coniah or
Jehoiachin.</p>
<p>In the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar, in the reign of Zedekiah
the captain of the Babylonian army &ldquo;broke in pieces&rdquo;
the brazen vessels, but took the brass; and he broke in pieces
the gold and silver vessels, but took the gold and silver with
him to Babylon.&nbsp; So that the gold and silver vessels were
twice reduced to metal [2 Kings, xxv., 13&ndash;16].&nbsp;
Jeremiah [lii., 17&ndash;23] enters into minute details.</p>
<p>These vessels seem to have possessed a wonderful recreative
power.&nbsp; They were always being taken away to supply a
temporary want of money, yet were always in the temple ready for
a new spoliation.</p>
<p class="gutlist">(1)&nbsp; Shishak, king of Egypt, in the 5th
year of king Rehoboam, <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>&ldquo;took away the treasures of the
house of the Lord; he even took away <i>all</i>; and he took away
all the shields of gold which Solomon had made&rdquo; [1 Kings,
xiv., 25&ndash;26].</p>
<p class="gutlist">(2)&nbsp; Asa followed the example of Shishak,
for he also &ldquo;took <i>all</i> the silver and gold left in
the treasures of the house of the Lord&rdquo; to give to Benhadad
king of Syria. [1 Kings, xv., 18.]</p>
<p class="gutlist">(3)&nbsp; Jehoash, king of Judah, could not
take away Solomon&rsquo;s vessels of gold and silver, because
they were gone already, but he &ldquo;took all the hallowed
things that Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah had dedicated, and
his own hallowed things, and all the gold found in the treasures
of the house of the Lord . . . and sent it to Hazael king of
Syria.&rdquo; [2 Kings, xii. 18.]</p>
<p class="gutlist">(4)&nbsp; Jehoash, king of Israel, also
&ldquo;took <i>all</i> the gold and silver, and all the vessels
found in the house of the Lord,&rdquo; and returned to Samaria
with his spoils. [2 Kings, xiv., 14.]</p>
<p class="gutlist">(5)&nbsp; Ahaz, king of Judah, wanted money,
and followed the example of his predecessors, for he also
&ldquo;took the silver and the gold found in the house of the
Lord,&rdquo; and sent it to the king of Assyria. [2 Kings, xvi.,
8.]</p>
<p class="gutlist">(6)&nbsp; We have not to tarry long before we
come to Hezekiah, who &ldquo;gave the king of Assyria all the
silver found in the house of the Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;cut off
the gold from the doors and pillars to give to the king of
Assyria.&rdquo;&nbsp; [2 Kings, xviii., 15&ndash;16.]</p>
<p class="gutlist">(7)&nbsp; Once more the temple was spoiled,
before we come to the final spoliations by the king of Babylon,
in the 8th year of Jehoiachim king of Judah.&nbsp; This has been
alluded to already.</p>
<p>It will be observed that it is not always said that the
vessels were taken out of the temple, but in several of the
spoliations it is said simply that the treasures were taken out
of the house of the Lord; by turning, however, to 1 Kings, vii.,
51, it will be seen that the &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; include the
vessels, for we are told that &ldquo;the silver, and the gold,
and the vessels, did Solomon put among the treasures of the house
of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence Shishak took away all the treasures of the temple, all
the silver and the gold and the vessels that Solomon had placed
there.&nbsp; If <i>all</i> in this case means less than all we
have Asa to follow, who took away &ldquo;all that was
left.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Jehoash,
made new vessels and hallowed things, but Jehoash gave all these
to Hazael king of Syria; and though all the treasures were given
away already, the king of Israel makes a raid on the temple and
carries off <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>to Samaria &ldquo;all the vessels&rdquo; both of silver
and of gold; Ahaz does the same; Hezekiah takes all the silver
vessels and cuts off all the gold ornaments of the doors and
pillars.&nbsp; After this comes Nebuchadnezzar, who finds all the
vessels of Solomon somehow still treasured in the temple, and
seizing on them he cuts them to pieces, but they are not yet
destroyed nor even lost, for some 10 or 11 years afterwards
Nebuzzar-adan, captain of the guard of the king of Babylon, lays
his hand on the sacred vessels, and took them &ldquo;in gold and
in silver&rdquo; to Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp; Ezra tells us the
number amounted to 5400, but how they could be given to so many,
cut to pieces and repaired, sent to Assyria, Samaria, and Syria,
yet be all wonderfully found safe and sound in a temple in
Babylon, is, to say the least, past understanding.&nbsp; Come we
now to another class of errors.</p>
<h3>(<i>c</i>.)&nbsp; <i>Misstatements</i>.</h3>
<h4>Exod. vi., 3.</h4>
<p>God is represented as saying: &ldquo;I appeared unto Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, by the name God Almighty [El Shadday], but by
my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the name Jehovah occurs over and over again in the Book of
Genesis, and has given rise to the Jehovistic and Elohistic
controversy, made familiar to English readers by Bishop
Colenso.&nbsp; Abraham, we are told, built an altar to Jehovah
near Bethel [Gen. xii. 8.], and another in Hebron [Gen. xiii.,
18.] but stranger still, when the sacrifice of Isaac was stopped,
the patriarch called the spot Jehovah-Jireh [Gen. xxii.
14].&nbsp; How could he call it so, if the very name Jehovah was
unknown to him?</p>
<h4>Exod. xvii., 8&ndash;13.</h4>
<p>The children of Israel had scarcely entered the
&ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; when the Amalekites came to oppose
them.&nbsp; A severe battle ensued, in which the Israelites were
at first worsted, but ultimately the foe was &ldquo;put to the
sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole history leads to the belief that the people left
Egypt unarmed.&nbsp; They were slaves, and it is not at all
likely that Pharaoh would have suffered 600,000 slaves to carry
swords.&nbsp; It is very true that our English version says
&ldquo;the children of Israel went up <i>harnessed</i> out of the
land of Egypt&rdquo; [Exod. xiii., 18.], but the marginal reading
is &ldquo;by five in a rank,&rdquo; which seems the more
probable.&nbsp; No time was given <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>for preparation, for the people were
&ldquo;urgent to send them away in haste,&rdquo; they had not
even time to prepare food before they left, but &ldquo;took their
dough before it was leavened&rdquo; [Exod. xii., 34].&nbsp;
Having crossed the Red Sea, they would have no opportunity of
procuring swords, so that this battle must remain a mystery.</p>
<h4>1 Sam. xvii., 54.</h4>
<p>Here we are told that David, having cut off the head of
Goliath, &ldquo;carried it to Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; How could
this be, seeing that Jerusalem at the time was in the hand of the
Jebusites, and did not fall into the hand of the Israelites till
several years afterwards?&nbsp; When David slew the giant he was
a mere stripling, say 15 or 16 years of age, but when he took
Jerusalem from the Jebusites he was above 30. [2 Sam. v., 6.]</p>
<h4>2 Sam. vii., 12, 13, 16.</h4>
<p>The prophet Nathan is commanded by God to say that the Lord
&ldquo;will set up his seed after him, and establish the kingdom
of David for ever;&rdquo; and again &ldquo;thine house and thy
kingdom,&rdquo; says Nathan, &ldquo;shall be established for
ever, thy throne shall be established for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
is the fact?&nbsp; Solomon reigned 40 years, but towards the
close of his reign, sat on a very tottering throne; no sooner did
Rehoboam succeed than 10 parts out of 12 revolted; and in 380
years more the kingdom of Judah had ceased to exist; so that the
repeated promise of Nathan that the kingdom should endure for
ever proved altogether a failure.</p>
<h4>Jeremiah, xxxv., 18, 19.</h4>
<p>Precisely the same promise was made to the Rechabites, with
precisely the same results: &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel, because ye have obeyed the commandment of
Jonadab your father [to drink no wine], Jonadab, the son of
Rechab, shall not want a man to stand before me for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Great efforts have been made to show that the
Rechabites still exist; but I apprehend that few scholars will
place any reliance on the conflicting accounts.&nbsp; Brett
professes they are in Hungary; Niebuhr says they are in Medina;
the &ldquo;Bible Cyclop&aelig;dia&rdquo; asserts that they live
in Mecca; the missionary Wolff maintains that they live near
Jerusalem; Signor Pierotti affirms that he found them in the
vicinity of the Dead Sea.</p>
<h4><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>1
Kings, xxii., 19&ndash;23; 2 Chron. xviii., 22.</h4>
<p>We are here told that God himself sent lying spirits into His
prophets, not by way of punishment, but in order to mislead; so
that, admitting certain books to have been written by prophets,
and even that God sent His &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; to inspire them,
it by no means follows that the books are worthy of credit.&nbsp;
It is not enough to be a prophet, it is not enough to be moved by
the spirit, it is not enough that the spirit comes from God, we
must ourselves decide the all important question whether the
spirit is a &ldquo;lying spirit&rdquo; or the &ldquo;spirit of
truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two kings Ahab and Jehoshaphat enquired
of the prophets whether or not they should make war against the
Syrians, 400 prophets agreed in the answer, go, for &ldquo;the
Lord will deliver them into your hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing
could be plainer, nothing more decisive; but Michaiah says,
don&rsquo;t believe the prophets, &ldquo;for the Lord has put a
lying spirit into all their mouths&rdquo; to compass the
destruction of the two kings.&nbsp; Here were 400 who said
&ldquo;go,&rdquo; and one who said &ldquo;no,&rdquo; the prophets
have been deceived by a spirit of falsehood.&nbsp; Is it at all
credible that the God of truth would employ spirits of untruth to
go upon his missions?&nbsp; How can it be said that God abhors
lies when he employs lying spirits as his ministers?&nbsp; But,
without doubt, the lying prophet is recognised in Scripture, for
besides these 400 we have the lamentable tale of the old prophet
of Bethel, who told the prophet of Judah to go home with him,
declaring that the Lord had sent him, but &ldquo;he lied,&rdquo;
and the prophet of Judah was slain by a lion for trusting the
word of his brother prophet [1 Kings, xiii., 18].&nbsp; There is
an inconsistency in all this revolting to common sense; and so,
indeed, is there in the notion of the parliament referred to in
the book of Job [ii., 1], &ldquo;there is a day when the sons of
God present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan is present
amongst them,&rdquo; and God speaks to Satan and employs him to
do His bidding.&nbsp; Paul says there is no fellowship between
God and Belial, light and darkness, and he is right.</p>
<h4>2 Kings, iii., 15&ndash;20.</h4>
<p>Elisha said to the king of Israel, &ldquo;The Lord will
deliver the Moabites into your hands,&rdquo; and that Israel
should smite &ldquo;every fenced city of Moab, and every choice
city.&rdquo;&nbsp; None of this prophecy came true, and
why?&nbsp; Because the king of Moab, when &ldquo;he saw the
battle was too sore for him, sacrificed his eldest son on the
wall for a burnt offering.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Israelites, seeing
this, were panic struck, fled, and left the prophecy unfulfilled
[<i>see</i> verses 26, 27],</p>
<h4><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>2
Chron. xvi., 1.</h4>
<p>There is some great mistake here.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa,&rdquo; says the
chronicler, &ldquo;Baasha, King of Israel, came up against Judah,
and built Ramah;&rdquo; but what says the book of Kings?&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the third year of Asa, King of Judah, began Baasha to
reign over Israel, and he reigned twenty-four years&rdquo; [1
Kings, xv., 33]; if this latter statement is correct Baasha died
in the twenty-seventh year of the reign of Asa, and could not
have waged war against him nine years afterwards.</p>
<h4>Dan. i., 1.</h4>
<p>The writer says that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, laid
siege to Jerusalem in the <i>third year of Jehoiakim</i>; but
Jeremiah says [xxv., 1.] that the <i>fourth</i> year of Jehoiakim
was the <i>first</i> of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; So
that he was not king at all in the &ldquo;3rd year of
Jehoiakim.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Matt., i., 17.</h4>
<p>Matthew says, &ldquo;all the generations from Abraham to David
are fourteen; and from David to the captivity are fourteen; and
from the captivity to the birth of Christ are
fourteen.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is true in no sense.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;periods&rdquo; are quite unequal in length; the
&ldquo;genealogies&rdquo; are not alike in number; and fourteen
in no case is correct.&nbsp; According to Bible chronology the
first period was 911 years, the second 497, and the third
584.</p>
<h4>John, i., 18.</h4>
<p>The evangelist says&mdash;&ldquo;No man hath seen God at any
time;&rdquo; similarly we read in Exodus [xxxiii., 20],
&ldquo;There shall no man see my face and live.&rdquo;&nbsp; How
does this agree with Gen. xxxii., 24&ndash;30, where Jacob is
said to have wrestled all night with a mysterious being, and
&ldquo;called the name of the place Peniel, for I have seen God
face to face, and my life is preserved.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sarah also
&ldquo;looked upon God&rdquo; when she was told that her husband
would have a son [Gen. xvi., 13].&nbsp; Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and
Abihu, with the 70 elders of Israel &ldquo;saw the God of Israel
. . . they saw God, and did eat and drink&rdquo; [Exod. xxiv.,
9&ndash;11].&nbsp; Moses was on two occasions 40 days with God,
and saw his &ldquo;similitude,&rdquo; and spake to him
&ldquo;mouth to mouth&rdquo; [Numbers, xii., 8].&nbsp; Numerous
other instances will occur to every reader; if anything is
revealed in Scripture more positively than another, it is that
God has appeared to <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>many, from Adam to John, talked to them familiarly, and
they have lived.</p>
<h4>John, xxi., 25.</h4>
<p>John says, &ldquo;There are also many other things which Jesus
did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose
that even the world itself could not contain the books that
should be written.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will not go this length
respecting the mis-statements and errors of Scripture; but it
would be no exaggeration to say, if all were written down, this
pamphlet would not contain them.</p>
<p style="text-align:
center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> <i>We will conclude
this part of our subject with one or two errors of a different
sort</i>.</p>
<h4>Deut. i., 1.</h4>
<p>The writer says&mdash;&ldquo;These are the words which Moses
spake to all Israel on this side Jordan, in the plain over
against the Red Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time he was as near Jordan, and about as far from the
Red Sea as he well could be.&nbsp; The expression &ldquo;On this
side Jordan&rdquo; means in this verse <i>east</i> of the river,
but after the Israelites had come into the lot of their
inheritance, &ldquo;this side Jordan&rdquo; meant <i>west</i> of
the river, and east of it was called &ldquo;beyond Jordan&rdquo;
[Joshua, ix., 1, 10].</p>
<h4>Judges, vii., 3.</h4>
<p>This is another geographical error.&nbsp; It is stated that
Gideon ordered it to be proclaimed throughout his host that all
who had no stomach for the pending fight with the Midianites were
at liberty to depart early from Mount Gilead.</p>
<p>Now, the encampment of Gideon was in the valley of Jezreel,
west of the Jordan; whereas Mount Gilead is beyond Jordan, far
away from the site of the battle.</p>
<h4>2 Chron. xx., 35&ndash;37.</h4>
<p>This is a third example of geographical confusion, similar to
those marvellous blunders of old Homer.&nbsp; The chronicler says
that Jehoshaphat built ships in &ldquo;Ezion-gaber to go to
Tarshish.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ezion-gaber was a harbour in the Red Sea,
and Tarshish is generally supposed to be Tartessus, the famous
Ph&oelig;nician emporium near the mouth of the Guadalquiver, and
not far from the modern Cadiz.&nbsp; It was far more than the
navigators of Jewry could have accomplished to sail from the <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Red Sea to
Spain, and certainly Jehoshaphat would not have chosen that
harbour for building ships for the Mediterranean.</p>
<h4>Prov. vi., 6&ndash;8; xxx., 25.</h4>
<p>Solomon says: &ldquo;Go to the ant, thou sluggard&mdash;which
provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the
harvest.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt it was a vulgar error of very wide
diffusion that ants feed upon corn, and lay up a store of grain
in harvest time for winter use.&nbsp; Pliny, &AElig;lian, Ovid,
Virgil, Horace, <a name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a> and several in our own country, have
endorsed the instruction of Solomon, but what is the real
fact?&nbsp; In the first place, ants are dormant in winter; and
in the next place, they do not feed upon corn, but chiefly on
animal food.&nbsp; What Solomon and others supposed to be grains
of corn are in reality the cocoons which they bring out of their
nests in fine weather to air, and after they have exposed them to
the sun they carry them back again.&nbsp; Efforts have been made
to prove that there is a species of ant which lives on grain; but
even if such could be found, it is not the exception, but the
rule which must characterise the animal.&nbsp; No one would say
to a person, you are &ldquo;white as a rose,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;black as a cherry;&rdquo; though there are white roses and
black cherries.&nbsp; In all proverbial expressions and general
allusions, the ordinary character is referred to, and not the
exceptions.</p>
<h4>Matt, xiii., 31, 32; Mark, iv., 31, 32.</h4>
<p>Jesus said: &ldquo;A grain of mustard-seed . . . is the least
of all seeds, but when it is grown it is the greatest among
herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and
lodge in the branches thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not correct that the &ldquo;grain of mustard is the
least of all seeds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many seeds are smaller, as that
of the foxglove and tobacco plant; nor is it correct that mustard
anywhere grows into a tree, &ldquo;so that the birds of the air
come and lodge in the branches thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exaggeration in the corresponding verse of the second
Gospel is even greater than that of Matthew.&nbsp; Mark says:
&ldquo;It is less than [any of] the seeds that be sown in the
earth . . . but becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out
great branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Here,
again, critics have come forward to prove that the mustard seed
of the text was not mustard seed, but something else.&nbsp; Some
one fancies he has discovered a seed which better answers the
description, and says Jesus did not mean mustard, but the seed of
the critic.&nbsp; Such puerile defence does more harm than
good.&nbsp; Moses did not mean &ldquo;six days&rdquo; by <i>six
days</i>; Joshua did not mean that the &ldquo;sun was to stand
still,&rdquo; when he commanded it so to do; Solomon did not mean
&ldquo;ants&rdquo; by <i>ants</i>; nor Jesus,
&ldquo;mustard-seed&rdquo; by <i>mustard seed</i>.&nbsp; In fact,
words have no meaning, but may be fitted with a sliding scale to
fit the wishes and knowledge of every reader.&nbsp; The
dishonesty of this practice is palpable, and any system which
needs such shoring should be suffered to fall through its own
weakness.</p>
<h4>1 Chron. iv., 17; and 1 Chron. vii., 14.</h4>
<p>Being on the subject of blunders, we would commend our readers
to the two verses referred to above&mdash;&ldquo;The <i>sons</i>
of Ezra were Jether, Mered . . . and Jalon; and <i>she</i> bare
Miriam, Shammai, and Ishbah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>sons</i> of Manasseh [were]
Ashriel, whom <i>she</i> bare . . . and the name of the second
was Zelophehad.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know not if the reader can
understand these verses; I must candidly confess I am wholly
unable to attach any meaning whatever to them.</p>
<p>Another puzzle will be seen in Ecclesiastes, vii.,
27&ndash;29, but probably the translation is in great measure
responsible for the obscurity of this passage.&nbsp; The preacher
says: &ldquo;Behold, this have I found, counting one by one to
find out the account; which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not:
one man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all
those have I not found.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be no easy matter
to make out what the preacher &ldquo;has found,&rdquo; which
requires such a blowing of trumpets.&nbsp; The original Hebrew
may throw some light upon his meaning, but I am certain that if
any candidate for the civil service had written those verses, no
examiner would commend their perspicuity.</p>

<p>In the former part of this division numerous examples have

positively contradicts another.&nbsp; In the former part the
passages alluded to are obviously in error; in this part one text
will be contrasted with another contradictory text, but it will
not be possible to pronounce which is right, or whether both are
not equally in fault.&nbsp; It will suffice in many cases simply
to set one statement against another statement in separate
columns, and leave the reader to form his own judgment; but in
some few instances a remark or two will be given to point out the
scope of the error to which attention is directed.</p>

befallen it.&nbsp; David consulted the ephod, and was told to
pursue the &ldquo;rovers,&rdquo; for he should not only overtake
them, but should recover all that they had taken captive.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So David went, he and the <i>six hundred men</i> that were

left behind 200 of the men, and with the remaining 400 overtook

<p>These last two examples are not very weighty, but in a book
which professes to be inspired, and demands unreserved and
unconditional belief, we expect minute <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>accuracy.&nbsp; The argument we
advance is accumulative.&nbsp; Probably no book of good
reputation has so many contradictory passages as the Bible; the
examples referred to in this pamphlet form but a small part of
what might be brought forward, if we allowed ourselves a larger
space.</p>
<p>The examples given above are more or less connected with
figures.&nbsp; The rest of the examples to be stated are
independent of such sources of error.&nbsp; A few shall be given
in detail and others in parallel columns.</p>
<h4>Gen., i., 27.</h4>
<p>Adam and Eve, we are here told, were created on the sixth
day.&nbsp; The words are quite explicit, &ldquo;male and female
created he them, and God blessed them . . . and the evening and
the morning were the sixth day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are little prepared to hear in the very next chapter that
God did not create them a male and female on the sixth day, and
of course did not bless them.&nbsp; What is still more strange is
that the chapter opens with the words: &ldquo;Thus the heavens
and the earth were finished and all the host of them, and on the
seventh day God <i>ended</i> his work which he had
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to v. 21 we find that God did not rest from his work
at the close of the sixth day, nor was his work ended, nor was
woman yet made; for after this &ldquo;rest,&rdquo; or during this
&ldquo;sabbath,&rdquo; we are not told which, Adam being thrown
into a deep sleep, one of his ribs was abstracted, and out of
this rib was Eve made.</p>
<h4>Gen., iv. 14.</h4>
<p>After Cain had killed his brother Abel he was &ldquo;driven by
God from the face of the earth;&rdquo; and Cain said: &ldquo;My
punishment is greater than I can bear . . .&nbsp; I shall be a
fugitive and a vagabond in the earth, and it shall come to pass
that everyone that findeth me shall slay me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One would suppose from this that the world was populated at
the time, and not that Cain was the first-born of the human
race.</p>
<h4>Gen., xlix., 10.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The sceptre shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are told that Shiloh [<i>the peaceful
one</i>] means &ldquo;the son of peace,&rdquo; the Messiah, Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; If so, how thoroughly did facts contradict this
prophecy.&nbsp; Judah had no sceptre till David&rsquo;s time, 650
years after these words were <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>spoken; it held the sceptre 460
years, and it departed from Judah 580 years before Shiloh
came.</p>
<h4>Exodus, xx.</h4>
<p>The chapter contains the decalogue read in the Anglican
churches every Sunday morning.&nbsp; Moses broke the first pair
of stone tables, but having prepared two others Jehovah
&ldquo;wrote upon them the words that were on the first
tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By comparing Exod. xxxiv. with Exod. xx., it will be found
that there is very little resemblance between the first and
second decalogue.&nbsp; Only three of the ten commandments are at
all alike, the other seven of the first pair of tables find no
counterpart in the second.</p>
<h4>1 Sam., ix., 2.</h4>
<p>Saul is called &ldquo;a choice young man and a goodly,&rdquo;
yet had he at the time a son in man&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<h4>1 Sam., xv., 7&ndash;20.</h4>
<p>Saul positively affirms that he had &ldquo;utterly destroyed
all the Amalekites, except Agag,&rdquo; and him Samuel
&ldquo;hewed to pieces.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some twenty years after this
extirpation, David is appointed to destroy the very same people,
and he also &ldquo;smote them from the twilight even unto the
evening of the next day, and there escaped not a man of them,
save 400 young men, which fled on camels.&rdquo;&nbsp; (1 Sam.
xxx., 17.)&nbsp; (<i>See also</i> 1 Chron., iv.,
41&ndash;43.)</p>
<h4>1 Sam., xvi., 18.</h4>
<p>When David was introduced to king Saul, he is described as
&ldquo;a mighty valiant man, and a man of war;&rdquo; but in the
next chapter he is called a &ldquo;stripling unpracticed in
arms,&rdquo; and unused to armour.</p>
<p>In the former of these two chapters (v. 21), he is represented
as Saul&rsquo;s companion, who &ldquo;stood before the king, and
Saul loved him greatly;&rdquo; in the latter (xvii., 55, 56), he
becomes a stripling wholly unknown to the monarch and his
officers, for Saul asks Abner &ldquo;whose son is this youth? and
Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.&nbsp; And
Saul said, Inquire whose son the stripling is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet
this stripling was a &ldquo;mighty man of valour,&rdquo; who had
actually been Saul&rsquo;s &ldquo;armour bearer&rdquo; and
beloved companion.&nbsp; He had lived with Saul, had played to
him in his moody fits, and charmed away his ill-temper, had been
a cause of jealousy to <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>the king, who had even tried to kill
him, and yet neither Saul nor Abner had ever seen him or known
his name.</p>
<h4>2 Sam., viii., 17.</h4>
<p>The writer says there were two high priests during the
rebellion of David, one elected by Saul and the other by David:
they were, &ldquo;Zadok son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech son of
Abiathar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If anyone will read the narrative with tolerable care he will
see that Ahimelech was dead, having been slain by Doeg when he
put the city of Nob to the sword (1 Sam. xxii., 18); besides
Ahimelech was not the son but the father of Abiathar, (1 Sam.
xxii., 20; xxiii., 6), and the father of Ahimelech was Ahitub, a
&ldquo;fact&rdquo; repeated three times in as many verses, in 1
Sam. xxii., 9&ndash;12.</p>
<p>This blunder about Ahimelech has been copied into other
places, for example, 1 Sam. xx., 25; 1 Kings iv., 4; 1 Chronicles
xviii., 16, but there cannot be a shadow of doubt that Abiathar,
and not Ahimelech, was the high priest appointed by David: first,
because Abiathar fled to David for safety; secondly, because he
was the high priest during the entire reign of David; and
finally, because he was deposed by Solomon, who told him he would
have put him to death if he had not served before David. (1 Kings
ii., 26.)</p>
<h4>Jeremiah, xxii., 29, 30.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;O earth, earth, earth!&rdquo; exclaims the prophet,
&ldquo;hear the word of the Lord&mdash;Thus saith the Lord: Write
ye this man [Coniah] childless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to 1 Chronicles, iii., 17, 18, Coniah, or Je-coniah
had eight sons, viz: Assir, Salathiel, Malchiram, Pedaiah,
Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah.</p>
<h4>Jeremiah, xxxvi., 30.</h4>
<p>Jehovah told Jeremiah that Jehoiakim &ldquo;should have none
to sit on the throne of David:&rdquo; but we are told (2
Chronicles xxxvi., 8) that his son succeeded him, and after his
son his brother.</p>
<h4>Ezekiel, xxx., 13.</h4>
<p>This and the two following chapters speak of the conquest of
Egypt by Babylon.&nbsp; The writer says that the country should
be made desolate from north to south, and that there should be
&ldquo;no more a prince of Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Not one
word of this corresponds with the known history of Egypt.&nbsp;
Herodotus does not give the slightest hint of such a
calamity.&nbsp; Merchants frequented the country without
interruption long after that, and if the people had been
scattered, the cities utterly wasted for 40 years, and &ldquo;no
king had succeeded to the throne,&rdquo; it must have been
known.&nbsp; The silence of historians on this point is a most
conclusive proof that the logic of fact did not accord with the
word of prophecy.</p>
<p>The same may be said of the Pharaoh drowned in the Red
Sea.&nbsp; No history confirms this tale, and no king of Egypt
can be made to tally with the catastrophe.&nbsp; But Egypt was
not an insignificant kingdom like Judah, which no one knew about;
it was the foremost kingdom of the world, and if one of its kings
had been drowned in the sea with all his host, some mention must

<p>Take another example.&nbsp; Both Matthew and Luke labour to
prove the genealogy of Christ from David.&nbsp; Luke traces
Joseph to Adam, through David (iii., 23&ndash;36), and Matthew
gives the descendants of David down to &ldquo;Joseph, the husband
of Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; The object of both is to show that Jesus,
through Joseph, came in the direct line, and was therefore of the
lineage of David.</p>
<p>The interpolated miraculous conception, abandoned by biblical
scholars, <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> utterly stultifies the purpose of these
pedigrees.&nbsp; Matthew and Luke &ldquo;prove&rdquo; that Jesus
was of the lineage of David because Joseph, the husband of Mary,
was in the direct line.&nbsp; The miraculous conception goes to
show that Joseph was <i>not</i> the father of Jesus, and
consequently that Jesus was not of the line of David at
all.&nbsp; Here, then, is a dilemma:&mdash;<i>if Jesus was the
son of Joseph his divinity must be given up</i>; <i>if he was not
the son of Joseph</i>, <i>he was not of the line of David</i>,
<i>and his Messiahship must be given up</i>.</p>
<p>By casting an eye over the two genealogies, it will be seen
that they differ in all points except at certain nodes, and the
usual answer is, that Luke&rsquo;s is the pedigree of Joseph, and
Matthew&rsquo;s that of Mary.&nbsp; But there is not the
slightest indication of this difference in the Gospel text; both
profess to give the genealogy of Joseph.&nbsp; Matthew says,
&ldquo;Jacob begat <i>Joseph</i>, the husband of Mary, of whom
Jesus was born&rdquo; (i., 16); there cannot be a shadow of doubt
that this is meant for the pedigree of Joseph, the husband of
Mary.&nbsp; If not, the genealogy was that of Rahab the harlot,
for verse 5 tells us that Boaz was the husband of Rahab, of whom
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Obed was
born.&nbsp; So again in verse 6, Bathsheba is given as the wife
of David, and mother of Solomon.&nbsp; Luke says (iii., 23),
Jesus was [as was supposed] the son of Joseph, the son of Heli;
and does not even mention Mary.&nbsp; The three words in brackets
are a mere gloss, and could not have been written by Luke, as
they would destroy the very thing he was trying to prove: Jesus
was the son of Joseph, Joseph of Heli, and Heli was a descendant
of David, Abraham, and Seth.&nbsp; If Jesus was not really the
son of Joseph, why trouble himself to show that Joseph was in the
line of David, Abraham, and Seth?</p>
<p>But it is quite evident that Matthew and Luke supposed Jesus
to be the son of Joseph.&nbsp; So did the neighbours of Joseph
and Mary, for they said (Matt, xiii., 55), &ldquo;Is not this the
carpenter&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;&nbsp; It never oozed out in his
native village that Mary&rsquo;s son was other than her son in
the usual course of nature.&nbsp; Even Mary herself says to Jesus
&ldquo;thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing&rdquo; (Luke
ii., 48); Mary calls Joseph the father, and not the reputed
father, of Jesus, and never seems to have had a shadow of doubt
about it.&nbsp; So was it with the disciples; their adherence to
Jesus had nothing to do with his divinity.&nbsp; They none of
them ever hint at such a notion.&nbsp; Philip said to Nathaniel
&ldquo;We have found him of whom Moses spoke, Jesus of Nazareth,
the son of Joseph&rdquo; (John i., 45); not Jesus of Nazareth,
the son of Jehovah, but Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
Joseph.&nbsp; All were anxious to prove his lineage from David,
and none cared to set aside so very important a point.&nbsp; Of
course they spoke of him as &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; but Christ was
merely an accepted title for &ldquo;King of the theocracy,&rdquo;
and in order that Jesus might be the &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; it was
absolutely essential that he should be a descendant of David. <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a>&nbsp; <i>The interpolated legend of the
miraculous conception is a fatal blunder</i>, <i>and if accepted
would utterly destroy the claim of Jesus to the
Messiahship</i>.</p>

55</span>Two things strike us in reading the latter passage: (1)
Adam did not &ldquo;surely die&rdquo; <i>on the day</i> he ate of
the forbidden fruit; and (2) there is not the slightest hint to
justify the common dogma that <i>death</i> was the penalty
incurred by Adam, but simply <i>toil</i>&mdash;toil <i>till</i>
he died.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread <i>till</i> thou return unto the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the subject of death it may be here remarked that the
scripture makes mention of thousands and hundreds of thousands,
who are not to die at all.&nbsp; We have the case of Enoch (Gen.,
v., 24), the case of Elijah (2 Kings, ii., 11), and all the
inhabitants of the earth who will be alive &ldquo;at the last
day&rdquo; (1 Corinthians, xv., 51).&nbsp; Either death is not
&ldquo;the wages of sin,&rdquo; or these persons are not of the
race of Adam.&nbsp; The &ldquo;curse&rdquo; is not transmitted to
them; if not to them, why to others?&nbsp; And what becomes of
the dogma of Adam and Christ as federal heads?&nbsp; The whole
theory is utterly overturned.</p>

61</span>CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p>The apology that a certain degree of variance is a proof of
independent testimony is quite beside the present question, and
so is the argument of Dr. Whately about Napoleon.&nbsp; No doubt
half-a-dozen correspondents describing any event in the late war
would dwell on different incidents, and see matters from
different stand-points; one would have a bias towards the French
and another towards the Prussians, one would be cast in a Tory
mould and another would have Radical proclivities, one would see
with military eyes and another with the eyes of a civilian, one
would look towards the end and another would limit his vision to
the present action; but who claims for these correspondents
divine inspiration? who believes that they are all baptized into
one spirit, and that the spirit which guides them has guaranteed
that they shall speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth?&nbsp; They write as human beings, with fallible
judgments, and all the prejudices of caste, education, interest,
and special advocacy; with so many things to bias judgment, no
doubt there will be considerable variety of statement, but all
this in no wise applies to the Bible writers&mdash;they are not
supposed to write from any of these motives, but to be guided and
directed by one and the same motive, and all to be led by the
Spirit of unerring truth.&nbsp; With such writers there may be
considerable verbal difference, but no substantial variety; there
may be shades of variety, and different incidents may strike
different eye-witnesses, but there can be no positive
contradiction, and the same incident cannot be described as two
antagonistic facts.&nbsp; If Samuel was right when he affirmed
that David took from the king of Zobah 700 horsemen, the
chronicler was wrong when he said the number was 7000.&nbsp; If
the chronicler was correct in saying that Jehoiachim was only
eight when he ascended the throne, his brother chronicler was in
error when he declared that he was eighteen.&nbsp; If Jesus was
the son of Joseph and Joseph a descendant of David, then Jesus
was of the lineage of David; but if he was the son of quite
another line he was not of the line of David.&nbsp; If the writer
of the book of Kings was right in saying that no vessels of gold
and silver were made of the money collected in the temple by <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Jehoash, the
writer of the book of Chronicles could not be correct in saying
that all sorts of gold and silver vessels were made
therefrom.&nbsp; If Matthew was right in saying that the soldiers
arrayed Jesus in a &ldquo;scarlet robe,&rdquo; Mark and John were
wrong in pronouncing it to be a &ldquo;purple garment;&rdquo; and
if Jesus said to Peter, before the cock crow thou shalt deny me
thrice, he did not say before the cock crow <i>twice</i> thou
shalt deny me thrice.&nbsp; If the writers were eye and ear
witnesses, and if the guiding Spirit of God brought to their
remembrance what Jesus said and did, such discrepancies could not
have occurred.</p>
<p>These contradictions, and their number is legion, are not the
shades of variety, the verbal differences of independent writers
of truth, they are irreconcilable statements, one of which must
be wrong, and if both claim to be guided by the Spirit of
Infallible Truth, their claim cannot be allowed.&nbsp; It cannot
be true that 22 is 42 and 7000 the same as 600; but give up
inspiration and place the Bible on the same platform as any other
ancient record, then everyone is at liberty to weigh its
statements and to hold fast just so much as is consistent with
the advanced knowledge of science, the general scope of
experience, and the harmony of history.</p>

class="footnote">[20a]</a>&nbsp; It is obvious that the Book of
the Kings, whether of Judah or Israel, is not the record called
the first and second Book of Kings in our Bible, for it is not
unfrequently referred to in the Chronicles, for &ldquo;the rest
of the acts&rdquo; of certain kings, but the account in our Books
of Kings, in some cases at any rate, is far more meagre than that
of the Chronicles.&nbsp; To give one example: 2 Chron. xxvii., 7,
refers us for a more detailed account to the book of the
&ldquo;Kings of Israel and Judah,&rdquo; but the record given in
2 Kings, xv., 36&ndash;38, is far less ample than that of the
Chronicler.&nbsp; It is no less certain that the book called
&ldquo;The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel&rdquo; cannot be our
books of Chronicles, inasmuch as they wholly omit the Kings of
Israel, and speak only of the Kings of Judah.</p>
<p><a name="footnote20b"></a><a href="#citation20b"
class="footnote">[20b]</a>&nbsp; Perhaps this expression may mean
&ldquo;the general scope of his preaching,&rdquo; and not a
book.&nbsp; It may go for what it is worth, and can in no wise
affect the question at issue.</p>
<p><a name="footnote22"></a><a href="#citation22"
class="footnote">[22]</a>&nbsp; Take two examples of this
etymology.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Hebrew</span> is supposed to
be derived from Heber, sou of Salah, great-grandson of Shem, who
is called &ldquo;the father of all the children of Heber&rdquo;
(Gen. x., 21&ndash;24); but Abraham, the 6th remove from Heber,
is called a Hebrew after he crossed over into Canaan (Gen. xiv.,
13).&nbsp; The more probable derivation of the word is
<i>heber</i> (an emigrant, one that has crossed over); if so,
Abraham was called a <i>hebrew</i> because he was a sojourner who
had crossed over into the &ldquo;land of promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, <span class="smcap">Canaan</span> is said to have been
so called from Canaan son of Ham, and Canaan&rsquo;s eldest son
was, according to the same authority, Sidon, founder of the
Sidonians, and his other sons were founders of the Hittites,
Jebusites, Amorites, Girgasites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites (Gen. x., 15&ndash;18).</p>
<p>All this is most improbable, although in keeping with the
practice of ancient chroniclers.&nbsp; Modern historians find
more probable derivations in some local peculiarity or suggestive
characteristic.&nbsp; Thus Argos, in Greece, is mythically
derived from Argos, its 4th king; but Strabo tells us the word
means <i>a plain</i>.&nbsp; Devonshire is not a corruption of
Debon&rsquo;s share or lot (<i>Faery Queen</i> ii., 10), but of
the Saxon <i>defn-afon</i> (deep water).&nbsp; Similarly Canaan
means <i>low lands</i>, as opposed to &ldquo;Aram&rdquo; (the
highlands), and being suited to commerce from its nearness to the
coast, the word in time became a general term for &ldquo;a
trader.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote23"></a><a href="#citation23"
class="footnote">[23]</a>&nbsp; Arphaxad was born &ldquo;two
years after the flood&rdquo; [Gen. xi., 10]; at the age of 35 he
had a son, Salah [v., 12], in thirty more years Salah had his son
Eber, and before Pelez was born, which was 34 years later, the
Dispersion had taken place.</p>
<p><a name="footnote24"></a><a href="#citation24"
class="footnote">[24]</a>&nbsp; It may be safely asserted that
population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical
progression of such a nature as to double itself every 25
years.&mdash;<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, vol. xviii.,
p. 3, col.&nbsp; Practically, such an instance is rare, if not
wholly uninstanced.&nbsp; Take the increase of England and Wales
as an example.&nbsp; In 1377 it was 2,092,978, in 1483 it was
4,689,000; in the 100 years, ending with 1800, the population had
increased from 5,475,000 to 8,675,000; and in the century ending
with 1860 it increased nearly threefold, the largest increase we
have experienced.&nbsp; [In 1760 it was 6,736,000, in 1861 it was
20,062,725.]</p>
<p><a name="footnote26a"></a><a href="#citation26a"
class="footnote">[26a]</a>&nbsp; The average size of an ox in the
herd is 60 stone (of 8 lbs.), and of a sheep six stone.&nbsp;
When the Armistice of 28 days was lately proposed, the supply of
Paris for the time was estimated at 34,000 oxen, 8,000 sheep,
8,000 swine, 5,000 calves, 100,000 cwt. of salt meat, eight
million cwt. of hay and straw, 200,000 cwt. of meal, and 30,000
cwt. of dried vegetables.&nbsp; For the cooking of food, the
estimate was 100,000 tons of coals, and 14 million square feet of
wood.</p>
<p><a name="footnote26b"></a><a href="#citation26b"
class="footnote">[26b]</a>&nbsp; The absurdity of such an
increase as even the &ldquo;small&rdquo; supposition of doubling
every twenty years will be obvious to any one who will take the
trouble of working out the figures for 440 years, which would
bring us to the reign of David.&nbsp; At the Exodus the number
was three millions; if they doubled every twenty years the people
in the little kingdom of David would have been twelve and a half
trillion!!&nbsp; And if the increase of the book of Exodus is
taken as the standard the numbers must be increased a
hundred-fold.&nbsp; Now the whole population of the world is
somewhat more than 1,000 <i>millions</i>, so that in a space not
so large as Yorkshire, and three-fourths wilderness, would be
gathered together more than all the inmates of all the world
twelve thousand times over.</p>
<p><a name="footnote27a"></a><a href="#citation27a"
class="footnote">[27a]</a>&nbsp; The nominal limits of &ldquo;the
promised land&rdquo; were the Euphrates and Mediterranean Sea on
the east and west, the &ldquo;entrance of Hamath&rdquo; and
&ldquo;river of Egypt&rdquo; on the north and south, giving a
surface of 60,000 square miles; but Sidonia and Philistia on the
west, the land of the Moabites and Ammonites on the east never
belonged to the kingdom of David, the real extent of which was
about 45 miles broad and 100 miles long.&nbsp; Yorkshire is 90 by
130, the principality of Wales 65 by 150; so that the entire
kingdom of David in its greatest extent was considerably smaller
than Yorkshire or Wales, and only one quarter of it was
inhabited, the rest being desert or wilderness.</p>
<p><a name="footnote27b"></a><a href="#citation27b"
class="footnote">[27b]</a>&nbsp; Take Prussia.&nbsp; Every
Prussian is liable to be called into military service as soon as
he attains his 20th year, and after he has completed his 27th
year he enters the Landwehr.&nbsp; Suppose war is proclaimed,
then every layman in Prussia between 20 and 27 is liable to be
called into the ranks, and would constitute a standing army of
200,000 strong; by adding the Landwehr of the first call, 100,000
more would be supplied; and by enrolling all who have not
rendered their full service to the state, the entire amount would
be increased to 600,000.&nbsp; How absurd, therefore, to speak of
double the number of soldiers in such a petty nation as Judah or
Israel!&nbsp; The entire population of Yorkshire is less than two
millions, of Wales not equal to &ldquo;David&rsquo;s army;&rdquo;
yet the entire kingdom of David was smaller than either, and more
than three-fourths of it was uninhabited!!</p>
<p><a name="footnote31"></a><a href="#citation31"
class="footnote">[31]</a>&nbsp; Our national debt is not half a
quarter of this sum, being somewhat less than 800 millions
sterling.&nbsp; Suppose an English historian had told us that a
king of wealthy England had laid by money enough to pay off the
national debt eight times, what would be thought of the
statement?&nbsp; But suppose we had been told that one of the
kings of Wales or of Northumbria had saved all this money for a
church, would the most credulous believe it?&nbsp; France finds
it no easy matter to raise 200 millions, and all Europe would be
puzzled to find the money <i>instanter</i>, but the king of a
little territory considerably smaller than Belgium managed to
raise that sum thirty-five times over.</p>

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
